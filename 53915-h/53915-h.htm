this book lived for many years in the Welsh Colony, Patagonia, where he
was the pioneer of the Anglican Church. He published a book dealing
with that part of the world, which also contained a great deal of
interesting matter regarding the little known Patagonian Indians, Ideas
on Religion and Customs, etc. He returned to Wales in 1891; and after
spending a few years in his native land, went out to a wild part of
Western Australia, and was the pioneer Christian worker in a district
called Colliefields, where he also built a church. (No one had ever
conducted Divine Service in that place before.)</p>
<p class="par">Here again, he found time to write his experiences, and
his book contained a great deal of value to the Folklorist, regarding
the aborigines of that country, quite apart from the ordinary account
of Missionary enterprise, history and prospects of Western Australia,
etc.</p>
<p class="par">In 1901, Mr. Ceredig Davies came back to live in his
native country, Wales.</p>
<p class="par">In Cardiganshire, and the centre of Wales, generally,
there still remains a great mass of unrecorded Celtic Folk Lore,
Tradition, and Custom.</p>
<p class="par">Thus it was suggested that if Mr. Ceredig Davies wished
again to write a book&mdash;the material for a valuable one lay at his
door if he cared to undertake it. His accurate knowledge of Welsh gave
him great facility for the work. He took up the idea, and this book is
the result of his labours. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e227"
href="#xd24e227" name="xd24e227">VI</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The main object has been to collect
&ldquo;verbatim,&rdquo; and render the Welsh idiom into English as
nearly as possible these old stories still told of times gone by.</p>
<p class="par">The book is in no way written to prove, or disprove, any
of the numerous theories and speculations regarding the origin of the
Celtic Race, its Religion or its Traditions. The fundamental object has
been to commit to writing what still remains of the unwritten Welsh
Folk Lore, before it is forgotten, and this is rapidly becoming the
case.</p>
<p class="par">The subjects are divided on the same lines as most of
the books on Highland and Irish Folk Lore, so that the student will
find little trouble in tracing the resemblance, or otherwise, of the
Folk Lore in Wales with that of the two sister countries.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par xd24e245"><span class="xd24e245init">W</span>elsh
folk-lore is almost inexhaustible, and of great importance to the
historian and others. Indeed, without a knowledge of the past
traditions, customs and superstitions of the people, the history of a
country is not complete.</p>
<p class="par">In this book I deal chiefly with the three counties of
Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, and Pembrokeshire, technically known in
the present day as &ldquo;West Wales&rdquo;; but as I have introduced
so many things from the counties bordering on Cardigan and Carmarthen,
such as Montgomery, Radnor, Brecon, etc., I thought proper that the
work should be entitled, &ldquo;The Folk-Lore of West and
Mid-Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Although I have been for some years abroad, in
Patagonia, and Australia, yet I know almost every county in my native
land; and there is hardly a spot in the three counties of Carmarthen,
Cardigan, and Pembroke that I have not visited during the last nine
years, gathering materials for this book from old people and others who
were interested in such subject, spending three or four months in some
districts. All this took considerable time and trouble, not to mention
of the expenses in going about; but I generally walked much, especially
in the remote country districts, but I feel I have rescued from
oblivion things which are dying out, and many things which have died
out already. I have written very fully concerning the old Welsh Wedding
and Funeral Customs, and obtained most interesting account of them from
aged persons. The &ldquo;Bidder&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; by Daniel Ddu,
which first appeared in the &ldquo;Cambrian Briton&rdquo; 1822, is of
special interest. Mrs. Loxdale, of Castle Hill, showed me a fine silver
cup which had been presented to this celebrated poet. I have also a
chapter on Fairies; but as I found that Fairy Lore has almost died out
in those districts which I visited, and the traditions concerning them
already recorded, I was <span class="corr" id="xd24e251" title=
"Source: oblige">obliged</span> to extract much of my information on
this subject from books, though I found a few new fairy stories in
Cardiganshire. But as to my chapters about Witches, Wizards, Death
Omens, I am indebted for almost all my information to old men and old
women whom I visited in remote country districts, and I may
emphatically state that I have not embellished the stories, or added to
anything I have heard; and care has been taken that no statement
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e254" href="#xd24e254" name=
"xd24e254">VIII</a>]</span>be made conveying an idea different from
what has been heard. Indeed, I have in nearly all instances given the
names, and even the addresses of those from whom I obtained my
information. If there are a few Welsh idioms in the work here and
there, the English readers must remember that the information was given
me in the Welsh language by the aged peasants, and that I have
faithfully endeavoured to give a literal rendering of the
narrative.</p>
<p class="par">About 350 ladies and gentlemen have been pleased to give
their names as subscribers to the book, and I have received kind and
encouraging letters from distinguished and eminent persons from all
parts of the kingdom, and I thank them all for their kind support.</p>
<p class="par">I have always taken a keen interest in the History and
traditions of my native land, which I love so well; and it is very
gratifying that His Royal Highness, the young Prince of Wales, has so
graciously accepted a genealogical table, in which I traced his descent
from Cadwaladr the Blessed, the last Welsh prince who claimed the title
of King of Britain.</p>
<p class="par">I undertook to write this book at the suggestion and
desire of Alice, Countess Amherst, to whom I am related, and who loves
all Celtic things, especially Welsh traditions and legends; and about
nine or ten years ago, in order to suggest the &ldquo;lines of
search,&rdquo; her Ladyship cleverly put together for me the following
interesting sketch or headings, which proved a good guide when I was
beginning to gather Folk-Lore:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">Another noble lady who was greatly interested in Welsh
Antiquities, was the late Dowager Lady Kensington; and her Ladyship,
had she lived, intended to write down for me a few Pembrokeshire local
traditions that she knew in order to record them in this book.</p>
<p class="par">In an interesting long letter written to me from
Bothwell Castle, Lanarkshire, dated September 9th, 1909, her Ladyship,
referring to Welsh Traditions and Folk-Lore, says:&mdash;&ldquo;I
always think that such things should be preserved and collected now,
before the next generation lets them go! ... <a id="xd24e282" name=
"xd24e282"></a>I am leaving home in October for India, for three
months.&rdquo; She did leave home for India in October, but sad to say,
died there in January; but her remains were brought home and buried at
St. Bride&rsquo;s, Pembrokeshire. On the date of her death I had a
remarkable dream, which I have recorded in this book, see page 277.</p>
<p class="par">I tender my very best thanks to Evelyn, Countess of
Lisburne, for so much kindness and respect, and of whom I think very
highly as a noble lady who deserves to be specially mentioned; and also
the young Earl of Lisburne, and Lady Enid Vaughan, who have been
friends to me even from the time when they were children.</p>
<p class="par">I am equally indebted to Colonel Davies-Evans, the
esteemed Lord Lieutenant of Cardiganshire, and Mrs. Davies-Evans, in
particular, whose kindness I shall never forget. I have on several
occasions had the great pleasure and honour of being their guest at
Highmead.</p>
<p class="par">I am also very grateful to my warm friends the Powells
of Nanteos, and also to Mrs. A. Crawley-Boevey, Birchgrove, Crosswood,
sister of Countess Lisburne.</p>
<p class="par">Other friends who deserve to be mentioned are, Sir
Edward and Lady Webley-Parry-Pryse, of Gogerddan; Sir John and Lady
Williams, Plas, Llanstephan (now of Aberystwyth); General Sir James and
Lady Hills-Johnes, and Mrs. Johnes of Dolaucothy (who have been my

<p class="par xd24e480"><span class="xd24e480init">U</span>ndoubtedly,
young men and young women all over the world from the time of Adam to
the present day, always had, and still have, their modes or ways of
associating or keeping company with one another whilst they are in
love, and waiting for, and looking forward to, the bright wedding day.
In Wales, different modes of courting prevail; but I am happy to state
the old disgraceful custom of bundling, which was once so common in
some rural districts, has entirely died out, or at least we do not hear
anything about it nowadays. I believe Wirt Sikes is right in his
remarks when he says that such a custom has had its origin in primitive
times, when, out of the necessities of existence, a whole household lay
down together for greater warmth, with their usual clothing on.</p>
<p class="par">Giraldus Cambrensis, 700 years ago, writes of this
custom in these words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p lang="la" class="par first">&ldquo;Propinquo concubantium calore
multum adjuti.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Of course, ministers of religion, both the Clergy of the
Church of England and Nonconformist ministers condemned such practice
very sternly, but about two generations ago, there were many
respectable farmers who more or less defended the custom, and it
continued to a certain extent until very recently, even without hardly
any immoral consequences, owing to the high moral standard and the
religious tendencies of the Welsh people.</p>
<p class="par">One reason for the prevalence of such custom was that in
times past in Wales, both farm servants and farmers&rsquo; sons and
daughters were so busy, from early dawn till a late hour in the evening
that they had hardly time or an opportunity to attend to their love
affairs, except in the night time. Within the memory of hundreds who
are still alive, it was the common <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2"
href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>practice of many of the young men
in Cardiganshire and other parts of West Wales, to go on a journey for
miles in the depth of night to see the fair maidens, and on their way
home, perhaps, about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning they would see a
ghost or an apparition! but that did not keep them from going out at
night to see the girls they loved, or to try to make love. Sometimes,
several young men would proceed together on a courting expedition, as
it were, if we may use such a term, and after a good deal of idle talk
about the young ladies, some of them would direct their steps towards a
certain farmhouse in one direction, and others in another direction in
order to see their respective sweethearts, and this late at night as I
have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">It was very often the case that a farmer&rsquo;s son and
the servant would go together to a neighbouring farm house, a few miles
off, the farmer&rsquo;s son to see the daughter of the house, and the
servant to see the servant maid, and when this happened it was most
convenient and suited them both. After approaching the house very
quietly, they would knock at the window of the young woman&rsquo;s
room, very cautiously, however, so as not to arouse the farmer and his
wife.</p>
<p class="par">I heard the following story when a boy:&mdash;A young
farmer, who lived somewhere between Tregaron and Lampeter, in
Cardiganshire, rode one night to a certain farm-house, some miles off,
to have a talk with the young woman of his affection, and after
arriving at his destination, he left his horse in a stable and then
entered the house to see his sweetheart. Meanwhile, a farm servant
played him a trick by taking the horse out of the stable, and putting a
bull there instead. About 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning the young
lover decided to go home, and went to the stable for his horse. It was
very dark, and as he entered the stable he left the door wide open,
through which an animal rushed wildly out, which he took for his horse.
He ran after the animal for hours, but at daybreak, to his great
disappointment, found that he had been running after a bull!</p>
<p class="par">Another common practice is to meet at the fairs, or on
the way home from the fairs. In most of the country towns and villages
there are special fairs for farm servants, both male and female, to
resort to; and many farmers&rsquo; sons and daughters attend them as
well. These fairs give abundant opportunity for association and
intimacy between young men and women.</p>
<p class="par">Indeed, it is at these fairs that hundreds of boys and
girls meet for the first time. A young man comes in contact with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>young girl, he gives her some &ldquo;fairings&rdquo;
or offers her a glass of something to drink, and accompanies her home
in the evening. Sometimes when it happens that there should be a
prettier and more attractive maiden than the rest present at the fair,
occasionally a scuffle or perhaps a fight takes place, between several
young men in trying to secure her society, and on such occasions, of
course, the best young man in her sight is to have the privilege of her
company.</p>
<p class="par">As to whether the Welsh maidens are prettier or not so
pretty as English girls, I am not able to express an opinion; but that
many of them were both handsome and attractive in the old times, at
least, is an historical fact; for we know that it was a very common
thing among the old Norman Nobles, after the Conquest, to marry Welsh
ladies, whilst they reduced the Anglo-Saxons almost to slavery. Who has
not heard the beautiful old Welsh Air, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Morwynion
Glan Meirionydd</span>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Pretty Maidens of
Merioneth&rdquo;)?</p>
<p class="par">Good many men tell me that the young women of the County
of Merioneth are much more handsome than those of Cardiganshire; but
that Cardiganshire women make the best wives.</p>
<p class="par">Myddfai Parish in Carmarthenshire was in former times
celebrated for its fair maidens, according to an old rhyme which
records their beauty thus:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mae eira gwyn ar ben y bryn,</p>
<p class="line">A&rsquo;r glasgoed yn y Ferdre,</p>
<p class="line">Mae bedw m&acirc;n ynghanol Cwm-bran,</p>
<p class="line">A merched gl&acirc;n yn Myddfe.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Principal Sir John Rhys translates this as

<p class="line">And lovely girls in Myddfe.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In the time of King Arthur of old, the fairest
maiden in Wales was the beautiful Olwen, whom the young Prince Kilhwch
married after many adventures. In the Mabinogion we are informed that
&ldquo;more yellow was her hair than the flowers of the broom, and her
skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands
and her fingers than the blossoms of the wood-anemone, amidst the spray
of the meadow fountain. The eye of the trained hawk, the glance of the
three-mewed falcon, was not brighter than hers. Her bosom was more
snowy than the breast of the white swan; her cheek was redder than the
reddest roses. Those who beheld her were filled with her love. Four
white trefoils sprang up wherever she trod. She was clothed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and about her neck
was a collar of ruddy gold, on which were precious emeralds and
rubies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A good deal of courting is done at the present day while
going home from church or chapel as the case may be. The Welsh people
are very religious, and almost everybody attends a place of worship,
and going home from church gives young people of both sexes abundant
opportunities of becoming intimate with one another. Indeed, it is
almost a general custom now for a young man to accompany a young lady
home from church.</p>
<p class="par">The Welsh people are of an affectionate disposition, and
thoroughly enjoy the pleasures of love, but they keep their love more
secret, perhaps, than the English; and Welsh bards at all times have
been celebrated for singing in praise of female beauty. Davydd Ap
Gwilym, the chief poet of Wales, sang at least one hundred love songs
to his beloved Morfudd.</p>
<p class="par">This celebrated bard flourished in the fourteenth
century, and he belonged to a good family, for his father, Gwilym Gam,
was a direct descendant from Llywarch Ap Bran, chief of one of the
fifteen royal tribes of North Wales; and his mother was a descendant of
the Princes of South Wales. According to the traditions of
Cardiganshire people, Davydd was born at Bro-Gynin, near Gogerddan, in
the Parish of Llanbadarn-Fawr, and only a few miles from the spot where
the town of Aberystwyth is situated at present.</p>
<p class="par">An ancient bard informs us that Taliesin of old had
foretold the honour to be conferred on Bro-Gynin, in being the
birthplace of a poet whose muse should be as the sweetness of
wine:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Am Dafydd, gelfydd goelin&mdash;praff awdwr,</p>
<p class="line xd24e550">Prophwydodd Taliesin,</p>
<p class="line xd24e552">Y genid ym mro Gynin,</p>
<p class="line xd24e552">Brydydd a&rsquo;i gywydd fel gwin.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The poet, Davydd Ap Gwilym, is represented as a
fair young man who loved many, or that many were the young maidens who
fell in love with him, and there is one most amusing tradition of his
love adventures. It is said that on one occasion he went to visit about
twenty young ladies about the same time, and that he appointed a
meeting with each of them under an oak-tree&mdash;all of them at the
same hour. Meanwhile, the young bard had secretly climbed up the tree
and concealed himself among the branches, so that he might see the
event of this meeting. Every one of the young girls was there
punctually at the appointed time, and equally astonished to perceive
any female there besides herself. They looked at one another in
surprise, and at last one of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5"
href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>asked another, &ldquo;What brought
you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;to keep an appointment with Dafydd ap
Gwilym&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I came also&rdquo;
said the other &ldquo;and I&rdquo; added a third girl, and all of them
had the same tale. They then discovered the trick which Dafydd had
played with them, and all of them agreed together to punish him, and
even to kill him, if they could get hold of him. Dafydd, who was
peeping from his hiding-place amongst the branches of the tree, replied
as follows in rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Y butein wen fain fwynnf&mdash;o honoch</p>
<p class="line xd24e550">I hono maddeuaf,</p>
<p class="line xd24e552">Tan frig pren a heulwen haf,</p>
<p class="line xd24e552">Teg anterth, t&rsquo;rawed gyntaf!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The words have been translated by someone
something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd24e572">&ldquo;If you can be so cruel,</p>
<p class="line">Let the kind wanton jade,</p>
<p class="line">Who oftenest met me in this shade,</p>
<p class="line">On summer&rsquo;s morn, by love inclined,</p>
<p class="line">Let her strike first, and I&rsquo;m
resigned.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Dafydd&rsquo;s words had the desired effect. The
young women began to question each other&rsquo;s purity, which led to a
regular quarrel between them, and, during the scuffle, the poet escaped
safe and sound.</p>
<p class="par">After this the Poet fell in love with the daughter of
one Madog Lawgam, whose name was Morfudd, and in her honour he wrote
many songs, and it seems that he ever remained true to this lady. They
were <span class="corr" id="c5" title=
"Corrected by author from: secretely">secretly</span> married in the
woodland; but Morfudd&rsquo;s parents disliked the Poet so much for
some reason or other, that the beautiful young lady was taken away from
him and compelled to marry an old man known as Bwa Bach, or Little
Hunchback. Dafydd was tempted to elope with Morfudd, but he was found,
fined and put in prison; but through the kindness of the men of
Glamorgan, who highly esteemed the Poet, he was released. After this,
it seems that Dafydd was love-sick as long as he lived, and at last
died of love, and he left the following directions for his
funeral:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;My spotless shroud shall be of summer
flowers,</p>
<p class="line">My coffin from out the woodland bowers:</p>
<p class="line">The flowers of wood and wild shall be my pall,</p>
<p class="line">My bier, light forest branches green and tall;</p>
<p class="line">And thou shalt see the white gulls of the main</p>
<p class="line">In thousands gather then to bear my train!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">One of Dafydd&rsquo;s chief patrons was his
kinsman, the famous and noble Ivor Hael, Lord of Macsaleg, from whose
stock the present Viscount Tredegar is a direct descendant, and, in
judging the character of the Poet we must take into consideration what
was the moral condition of the country in the fourteenth century.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=

<p class="par">But to come to more modern times, tradition has it that
a young man named Morgan Jones of Dolau Gwyrddon, in the Vale of Teivi,
fell in love with the Squire of Dyffryn Llynod&rsquo;s daughter. The
young man and the young woman were passionately in love with each
other; but the Squire, who was a staunch Royalist, refused to give his
consent to his daughter&rsquo;s marriage with Morgan Jones, as the
young man&rsquo;s grandfather had fought for Cromwell. The courtship
between the lovers was kept on for years in secret, and the Squire
banished his daughter to France more than once. At last the young lady
fell a victim to the small pox, and died. Just before her death, her
lover came to see her, and caught the fever from her, and he also died.
His last wish was that he should be buried in the same grave as the one
he had loved so dearly, but this was denied him.</p>
<p class="par">In Merionethshire there is a tradition that many
generations ago a Squire of Gorsygedol, near Harlech, had a beautiful
daughter who fell in love with a shepherd boy. To prevent her seeing
the young man, her father locked his daughter in a garret, but a secret
correspondence was carried on between the lovers by means of a dove she
had taught to carry the letters. The young lady at last died
broken-hearted, and soon after her burial the dove was found dead upon
her grave! And the young man with a sad heart left his native land for
ever.</p>
<p class="par">More happy, though not less romantic, was the lot of a
young man who was shipwrecked on the coast of Pembrokeshire, and washed
up more dead than alive on the seashore, where he was found by the
daughter and heiress of Sir John de St. <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e612" title="Source: Brides">Bride&rsquo;s</span>, who caused him
to be carried to her father&rsquo;s house where he was hospitably
entertained. The young man, of course, was soon head and ears in love
with his fair deliverer, and the lady being in nowise backward in
response to his suit, they married and founded a family of Laugharnes,
and their descendants for generations resided at Orlandon, near St.
Bride&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">The Rev. D. G. Williams in his interesting Welsh
collection of the Folk-lore of Carmarthenshire says that in that part
of the county which borders on Pembrokeshire, there is a strange custom
of presenting a rejected lover with a yellow flower, or should it
happen at the time of year when there are no flowers, to give a yellow
ribbon.</p>
<p class="par">This reminds us of a curious old custom which was
formerly very common everywhere in Wales; that of presenting a rejected
lover, whether male or female, with a stick or sprig of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>hazel-tree.
According to the &ldquo;Cambro Briton,&rdquo; for November, 1821, this
was often done at a &ldquo;Cyfarfod Cymhorth,&rdquo; or a meeting held
for the benefit of a poor person, at whose house or at that of a
neighbour, a number of young women, mostly servants, used to meet by
permission of their respective employers, in order to give a
day&rsquo;s work, either in spinning or knitting, according as there
was need of their assistance, and, towards the close of the day, when
their task was ended, dancing and singing were usually introduced, and
the evening spent with glee and conviviality. At the early part of the
day, it was customary for the young women to receive some presents from
their several suitors, as a token of their truth or inconstancy. On
this occasion the lover could not present anything more odious to the
fair one than the sprig of a &ldquo;collen,&rdquo; or hazel-tree, which
was always a well-known sign of a change of mind on the part of the
young man, and, consequently, that the maiden could no longer expect to
be the real object of his choice. The presents, in general, consisted
of cakes, silver spoons, etc., and agreeably to the respectability of
the sweetheart, and were highly decorated with all manner of flowers;
and if it was the lover&rsquo;s intention to break off his engagement
with the young lady, he had only to add a sprig of hazel. These pledges
were handed to the respective lasses by the different
&ldquo;Caisars,&rdquo; or Merry Andrews,&mdash;persons dressed in
disguise for the occasion, who, in their turn, used to take each his
young woman by the hand to an adjoining room where they would deliver
the &ldquo;pwysi,&rdquo; or nose-gay, as it was called, and afterwards
immediately retire upon having mentioned the giver&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="par">When a young woman also had made up her mind to have
nothing further to do with a young man who had been her lover, or
proposed to become one, she used to give him a &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">ffon wen</span>,&rdquo; (white wand) from an hazel tree, decorated
with white ribbons. This was a sign to the young man that she did not
love him.</p>
<p class="par">The Welsh name for hazel-tree is &ldquo;collen.&rdquo;
Now the word &ldquo;coll&rdquo; has a double meaning; it means to lose
anything, as well as a name for the hazel, and it is the opinion of
some that this double meaning of the word gave the origin to the custom
of making use of the hazel-tree as a sign of the loss of a lover.</p>
<p class="par">It is also worthy of notice, that, whilst the hazel
indicated the rejection of a lover, the birch tree, on the other hand,
was used as an emblem of love, or in other words that a lover was
accepted. Among the Welsh young persons of both sexes were able to make
known their love to one another without speaking, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>only by
presenting a <span class="corr" id="xd24e632" title=
"Source: Birchen&mdash;Wreath">Birchen-Wreath</span>. This curious old
custom of presenting a rejected lover with a white wand was known at
Pontrhydfendigaid, in Cardiganshire until only a few years ago. My
informant was Dr. Morgan, Pontrhydygroes. Mrs. Hughes, Cwrtycadno,
Llanilar, also informed me that she had heard something about such
custom at Tregaron, when she was young.</p>
<p class="par">It was also the custom to adorn a mixture of birch and
quicken-tree with flowers and a ribbon, and leave it where it was most
likely to be found by the person intended on May-morning. Dafydd ap
Gwilym, the poet, I have just referred to, mentions of this in singing
to Morfudd.</p>
<p class="par">Young people of both sexes, are very anxious to know
whether they are to marry the lady or the gentleman they now love, or
who is to be their future partner in life, or are they to die single.
Young people have good many most curious and different ways to decide
all such interesting and important questions, by resorting to uncanny
and romantic charms and incantations. To seek hidden information by
incantation was very often resorted to in times past, especially about
a hundred years ago, and even at the present day, but not as much as in
former times. It was believed, and is perhaps, still believed by some,
that the spirit of a person could be invoked, and that it would appear,
and that young women by performing certain ceremonies could obtain a
sight of the young men they were to marry.</p>
<p class="par">Such charms were performed sometimes on certain
Saints&rsquo; Days, or on one of the <span class="corr" id="xd24e641"
title="Source: three &ldquo;">&ldquo;Three</span> Spirits&rsquo;
Nights,&rdquo; or on a certain day of the moon; but more frequently on
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Nos Calan Gauaf</span>&rdquo; or All Hallows
Eve&mdash;the 31st. of October. All Hallows was one of the &ldquo;Three
Spirits&rsquo; Nights,&rdquo; and an important night in the calendar of
young maidens anxious to see the spirits of their future husbands.</p>
<p class="par">In Cardiganshire, divination by means of a ball of yarn,
known as &ldquo;<span lang="cy">coel yr edau Wlan</span>&rdquo; is
practised, and indeed in many other parts of Wales. A young unmarried
woman in going to her bedroom would take with her a ball of yarn, and
double the threads, and then she would tie small pieces of wool along
these threads, so as to form a small thread ladder, and, opening her
bedroom window threw this <span class="corr" id="xd24e652" title=
"Source: minature">miniature</span> ladder out to the ground, and then
winding back the yarn, and at the same time saying the following
words:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Y fi sy&rsquo;n dirwyn</p>
<p class="line xd24e550">Pwy sy&rsquo;n dal&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">which means:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I am winding,</p>
<p class="line xd24e550">Who is holding?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Then the spirit of the future husband of the girl who
was performing the ceremony was supposed to mount this little ladder
and appear to her. But if the spirit did not appear, the charm was
repeated over again, and even a third time. If no spirit was to be seen
after performing such ceremony three times, the young lady had no hope
of a husband. In some places, young girls do not take the trouble to
make this ladder, but, simply throw out through the open window, a ball
of yarn, and saying the words:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I am winding, who is holding.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Another custom among the young ladies of
Cardiganshire in order to see their future husbands is to walk nine
times round the house with a glove in the hand, saying the
while&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd24e676" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span><span lang="cy">Dyma&rsquo;r faneg, lle
mae&rsquo;r llaw.</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the glove,
where is the hand?&rdquo; Others again would walk round the dungheap,
holding a shoe in the left hand, and saying &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
shoe, where is the foot?&rdquo; Happy is the young woman who sees the
young man she loves, for he is to be her future husband.</p>
<p class="par">In Carmarthenshire young girls desirous of seeing their
future partners in life, walk round a leek bed, carrying seed in their
hand, and saying as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Hadau, hadau, hau,</p>
<p class="line">Sawl sy&rsquo;n cam, doed i grynhoi.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Seed, seed, sowing.</p>
<p class="line">He that loves, let him come to gather.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">It was also the custom in the same county for
young men and young women to go round a grove and take a handful of
moss, in which was found the colour of the future wife or
husband&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p class="par">In Pembrokeshire, it is the custom for young girls to
put under their pillow at night, a shoulder of mutton, with nine holes
bored in the blade bone, and at the same time they put their shoes at
the foot of the bed in the shape of the letter T, and an incantation is
said over them. By doing this, they are supposed to see their future
husbands in their dreams, and that in their everyday clothes. This
curious custom of placing shoes at the foot of the bed was very common
till very recently, and, probably, it is still so, not only in
Pembrokeshire, but with Welsh girls all over South Wales. A woman who
is well and alive told me once, that many years ago she had tried the
experiment herself, and she positively asserted that she actually saw
the spirit of the man who became her husband, coming near her bed, and
that happened when she was only a young girl, and some time before she
ever met the man. When she was telling me this, she had been married
for many years and had grown-up children, and I may add that her
husband was a particular friend of mine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Another well-known form of divination, often practised
by the young girls in Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire,
is for a young woman to wash her shirt or whatever article of clothing
she happens to wear next to the skin, and having turned it inside out,
place it before the fire to dry, and then watch to see who should come
at midnight to turn it. If the young woman is to marry, the spirit of
her future husband is supposed to appear and perform the work for the
young woman, but if she is to die single, a coffin is seen moving along
the room, and many a young girl has been frightened almost to death in
performing these uncanny ceremonies. The Rev. D. G. Williams in his
excellent Welsh essay on the Folk-lore of Carmarthenshire, mentions a
farmer&rsquo;s daughter who practised this form of divination whilst
she was away from home at school. A young farmer had fallen in love
with her, but she hated him with all her heart. Whilst she was
performing this ceremony at midnight, another girl, from mere mischief
dressed herself in man&rsquo;s clothing, exactly the same kind as the
clothes generally worn by the young farmer I have mentioned, and,
trying to appear as like him as possible, entered the room at the very
moment when the charm of invoking the spirit of a future husband was
being performed by the farmer&rsquo;s daughter, who went half mad when
she saw, as she thought, the very one whom she hated so much, making
his appearance.</p>
<p class="par">The other girls had to arouse their schoolmistress from
her bed immediately so that she might try and convince the young girl
that she had seen nothing, but another girl in man&rsquo;s clothes. But
nothing availed. The doctor was sent for, but he also failed to do
anything to bring her to herself, and very soon the poor young woman
died through fright and disappointment.</p>
<p class="par">Another common practice in West Wales is for a young
woman to peel an apple at twelve o&rsquo;clock, before a looking glass
in order to see the spirit of her future husband. This also is done on
All Hallow&rsquo;s Eve. Sowing Hemp Seed is also a well-known ceremony
among the young ladies of Wales, as well as England.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CANDLE AND PIN DIVINATION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was also the custom, at least many years ago,
if not now, for a young woman, or two of them together to stick pins at
midnight in a candle, all in a row, right from its top to the bottom,
and then to watch the candle burning and the pins dropping one by one,
till the last pin had dropped, and then the future husband of the girl
to whom the pin belonged, was supposed to appear; but if she was
destined to die single, she would see a coffin. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Another form of Divination, was to put the plates on the
dining-room table upside down, and at midnight the spirit of the future
husband was supposed to come and arrange them in their proper
order.</p>
<p class="par">Another custom resorted to in Cardiganshire and other
parts in order to see a future husband, or rather to dream of him, was
to eat a hen&rsquo;s first egg; but no one was to know the secret, and
absolute silence was to be observed, and the egg was to be eaten in
bed.</p>

<h3 class="main">GOING ROUND THE CHURCH.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This kind of divination was perhaps of a more
uncanny character than anything I have hitherto mentioned, and a custom
which both young men and young women very commonly practised, even
within the last 50 years as I have been told by old people. This weird
practice was to go round the parish church seven times, some say nine
times, whilst others again say nine times-and-half, and holding a knife
in the hand saying the while:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="cy" class="line">&ldquo;Dyma&rsquo;r twca, lle mae&rsquo;r
wain?&rdquo; <a id="xd24e724" name="xd24e724"></a></p>
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the knife, where is the
sheath?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It was also the practice to look in through the
key-hole of the church door each time whilst going round, and many
people assert to this very day that whoever performed this mode of
divination in proper order, that the spirit of his or her future wife
or husband would appear with a sheath to fit the knife; but, if the
young man or woman was to die single, a coffin would meet him or her.
Mr. John Jones, of Pontrhydfendigaid, an intelligent old man of 95,
with a wonderful memory, told me that, when a boy, he had heard his
mother giving a most sad account of what happened to a young woman who
did this at Ystrad Meurig in Cardiganshire about the year 1800. She was
the daughter of a public house in the village, and the name of her
mother was Catherine Dafydd Evan. Mr. Jones&rsquo;s mother knew the
family well; some of them emigrated to America.</p>
<p class="par">This young woman was in love with one of the students of
St. John&rsquo;s College, in the neighbourhood, and being anxious to
know whether he was to be her husband or not, she resorted to this
uncanny practice of walking nine times round Ystrad Meurig Church.
Around and round she went, holding the knife in her hand and repeating
the words of incantation, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the knife, where is the
sheath?&rdquo; And whilst she was performing her weird adventure, to
her great alarm, she perceived a clergyman coming out to meet her
through the church door with his white surplice <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>on, as
if coming to meet a funeral procession. The frightened young woman fell
down in a swoon, almost half dead, as she imagined that the one she met
with a surplice on was an apparition or the spirit of a clergyman
officiating at the phantom funeral of herself, which prognosticated
that instead of going to be married, she was doomed to die.</p>
<p class="par">It turned out that the apparition she had seen was only
one of the students, who, in order to frighten her, had secretly
entered the Church for the purpose. But the poor girl recovered not,
and she died very soon afterwards.</p>
<p class="par">I heard the following story from my mother when I was a
boy. A girl had determined to obtain a sight of her future husband by
going round the parish church nine times at All Hallows&rsquo; Eve in
the same manner as the young woman I mentioned in the above story, but
with more fortunate results. This also happened somewhere in
Cardiganshire or Carmarthenshire. Just as the young woman was walking
round the ninth time, she saw, to her great surprise, her own master
(for she was a servant maid) coming to meet her<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e738" title="Source: ,">.</span> She immediately ran home and
asked her mistress why she had sent her master after her to frighten
her. But the master had not gone out from the house. On hearing the
girl&rsquo;s account, the mistress was greatly alarmed and was taken
ill, and she apprehended that she herself was doomed to die, and that
her husband was going to marry this servant girl, ultimately. Then the
poor woman on her death bed begged the young woman to be kind to her
children, &ldquo;For you are to become the mistress here,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;when I am gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was also a custom in Wales once for nine young girls
to meet together to make a pancake, with nine different things, and
share it between them, that is, each of the girls taking a piece before
going to bed in order to dream of their future husbands.</p>
<p class="par">Another practice among young girls was to sleep on a bit
of wedding cake.</p>

<p class="par first">I remember the following test or divination
resorted to in Cardiganshire only about twelve years ago. It was tried
by young maidens who wished to know whether their husbands were to be
bachelors, and by young men who wished to know whether their wives were
to be spinsters. Those who performed this ceremony were blindfolded.
Then three basins or dishes were placed on the table, one filled with
clean water, the other with dirty water, and the third empty. Then the
young man or young woman as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>case might be advanced to the
table blindfolded and put their hand in the dish; and the one who
placed his hands in the clean water was to marry a maiden; if into the
foul water, a widow; but if into the empty basin, he was doomed to
remain single all his life. Another way for a young maiden to dream of
her future husband was to put salt in a thimble, and place the same in
her stockings, laying them under her pillow, and repeat an incantation
when going to bed. Meyrick in his History of Cardiganshire states that
&ldquo;Ivy leaves are gathered, those pointed are called males, and
those rounded are females, and should they jump towards each other,
then the parties who had placed them in the fire will be believed by
and married by their sweethearts; but should they jump away from one
another, then, hatred will be the portion of the anxious
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Testing a lover&rsquo;s love by cracking of nuts is also
well known in West and Mid-Wales.</p>
<p class="par">It was also a custom in the old times for a young girl
on St. John&rsquo;s Eve to go out at midnight to search for St.
John&rsquo;s Wort in the light of a glow worm which they carried in the
palm of their hand. After finding some, a bunch of it was taken home
and hung in her bedroom. Next morning, if the leaves still appeared
fresh, it was a good omen; the girl was to marry within that same year;
but, on the other hand, if the leaves were dead, it was a sign that the
girl should die, or at least she was not to marry that year.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE BIBLE AND KEY DIVINATION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Bible and Key Divination, or how to find out
the two first letters of a future Wife&rsquo;s or Husband&rsquo;s name
is very commonly practised, even now, by both young men and young
women. A small Bible is taken, and having opened it, the key of the
front door is placed on the <a class="biblink xd24e50" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ruth%201:16">16th verse
of the 1st Chapter of Ruth</a>:&mdash;&ldquo;And Ruth said, intreat me
not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee; for whither
thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest I will lodge; thy people
shall be my people, and thy God my God.&rdquo; Some take <a class=
"biblink xd24e50" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=song%208:6-7">Solomon&rsquo;s
Songs, Chapter viii., verses 6 and 7</a> instead of the above verse
from the Book of Ruth. Then the Bible is closed, and tied round with
the garter taken off the left leg of him or her who wishes to know his
or her future wife or husband&rsquo;s initials. A person cannot perform
this ceremony himself; he must get a friend with him to assist him. The
young man must put the middle finger of his right hand on the key
underneath the loop, and take care to keep the Bible steady.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Then the man, who does not consult the future,
repeats the above verse or verses, and when he comes to the appointed
letter, that is the first letter of the future wife&rsquo;s name, the
Bible will turn round under the finger. I was told at Ystrad Meurig,
that a few years ago, a young woman, a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, tried
this Bible and key divination; and whilst the ceremony was going on,
and her sister assisting her to hold the key under the Bible and
repeating the words, instead of the book turning round as she expected,
she saw a coffin moving along the room, which was a sign that she was
doomed to die single; and so it came to pass! The farmhouse where this
young woman lived is situated in the neighbourhood of Strata Florida,
Cardiganshire; but I do not wish to name the house. I have myself once
or twice witnessed this divination practised, but I never heard of a
coffin appearing, except in the case of the young woman just
mentioned.</p>

<h3 class="main">DIVINATION BY THE TEA-CUP.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Tea-cup divination is also very much practised by
young girls in Wales in order to find out some future events concerning
love affairs, future husbands, etc. There was a woman, who only died a
few years ago, in the parish of Llandyssul, near a small village called
Pontshan in Cardiganshire, who was considered an expert in the art of
fortune telling by a tea cup, at least young women and young men
thought so, and many of them resorted to her, especially those who were
in love or intending to marry. There was another one near Llandovery in
Carmarthenshire, and there are a few even at present to whom the
maidens go for consultation.</p>
<p class="par">But Welsh women, who are so fond of tea, can find out
many things themselves by means of the tea cup without resorting to
those who are considered experts in the art. When several of them meet
together to tea they help one another in divining their cups, and tea
drinking or sipping is the order of the day among the females of Wales.
After having emptied the cup, it is turned round three times in the
left hand, so that the tea-leaves may cover the surface of the whole
cup. Then the cup is placed in the saucer, bottom upwards, to drain,
for a few minutes before inspection. If the leaves are scattered evenly
round the sides of the cup, leaving the bottom perfectly clear, it is
considered a very good sign; but on the other hand when the bottom of
the cup appears very black with leaves, it is a very bad sign: some
trouble or some misfortune is near. When the leaves form a ring on the
side of the cup, it means that the girl who consults is to marry very
soon; but if the ring is at the bottom of the cup, disappointment
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>in love awaits her, or she is doomed to die
single. When the tea leaves form a cross or a coffin, that also is
considered a bad sign; but as a rule, a horse, a dog, or a bird
portends good. Two leaves seen in close proximity on the side of the
cup foretell a letter bringing good news. When there is a speck
floating on the surface of a cup of tea before drinking, some people
say it means a letter, a parcel, or a visitor, but a young girl takes
it to represent her lover, and she proves his faithfulness by placing
the speck on the back of her left hand, and <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e778" title="Source: strike">striking</span> it with the back of
her right hand. Should the speck or the small tea leaves stick to the
back of the left hand and cling or stick fast to the right hand when
striking it, it means that the young man is faithful; but on the other
hand, should it happen that the tea still remain on the left hand where
it was first placed, especially after striking it three times, the
young man is not to be depended upon. Some women can even tell by means
of the tea-cup what trade their admirer follows, the colour of their
future husband&rsquo;s hair, and many other such things.</p>
<p class="par">A lily is considered a most lucky emblem, if it be at
the top, or in the middle of the cup, for this is considered a sign
that the young man, or the young woman who consults, will have a good
and kind wife, or husband, who will make him or her happy in the
marriage estate, but on the other hand, a lily at the bottom of the
cup, portends trouble, especially if clouded, or in the thick.</p>
<p class="par">A heart, especially in the clear, is also a very good
sign, for it signifies joy and future happiness. Two hearts seen
together in the cup, the young man, or the young woman&rsquo;s wedding
is about to take place. Tea-cup divination is well-known all over the
Kingdom; and in the Colonies, especially Australia, it is by far more
popular than in England.</p>

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h2 class="main">WEDDING CUSTOMS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par xd24e796"><span class="xd24e796init">I</span>n times
past, Wales had peculiar and most interesting, if not excellent,
Wedding Customs, and in no part of the country were these old quaint
customs more popular, and survived to a more recent date than in
Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire. Therefore this book would be
incomplete without giving a full description of them.</p>
<p class="par">When a young man and a young woman had agreed together
to marry &ldquo;for better for worse,&rdquo; they were first of all to
inform their parents of the important fact. Then in due time, the young
man&rsquo;s father, taking a friend with him, proceeded to interview
the young woman&rsquo;s father, so as to have a proper understanding on
the subject and to arrange different matters, especially concerning
dowry, etc. I am writing more especially of a rural wedding among the
farmers.</p>
<p class="par">The young woman&rsquo;s father would agree to give with
his daughter, as her portion, household goods of so much value, a
certain sum of money, and so many cows, pigs, etc.; and the young
man&rsquo;s father, on his part, would agree to grant his son so much
money, horses, sheep, hay, wheat and other things, so that the young
couple might have a good start in the married life, &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">i ddechreu eu byd</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;to begin their world, as we
say in Welsh. Sometimes the young man&rsquo;s father on such occasions
met with opposition on the part of the young woman&rsquo;s father or
mother or other relations, at least we read that it happened so in the
case of the heir of Ffynonbedr, near Lampeter, long ago; for it seems
that when he tried to secure the daughter of Dyffryn Llynod, in the
parish of Llandyssul, as his bride, the reply was in Welsh rhyme as
follow:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Deunaw gwr a deunaw cledde,</p>
<p class="line">Deunaw gwas yn gwisgo lifre,</p>
<p class="line">Deunaw march o liw&rsquo;r scythanod,</p>
<p class="line">Cyn codi&rsquo;r ferch o Ddyffryn Llynod.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Anglicised, this meant that she could not be
secured without coming for her with eighteen gentlemen bearing eighteen
swords; eighteen servants wearing livery; and eighteen horses of the
colour of the woodpigeon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But such opposition was not often to be met with.</p>
<p class="par">After the parents had arranged these matters
satisfactorily, the next preliminary and important step was to send
forth a gwahoddwr, or Bidder, from house to house, to bid or invite the
guests to the Bidding and the Wedding.</p>
<p class="par">In connection with these old interesting customs, there
were the Bidding or invitation to the wedding; the Bidder, whose duty
it was formally to invite the guests; the Ystafell, or the
bride&rsquo;s goods and presents; the purse and girdle; the Pwython;
and the Neithior.</p>
<p class="par">The Bidding was a general invitation to all the friends
of the bride and bridegroom-elect to meet them at the houses of their
respective parents or any other house appointed for the occasion. All
were welcomed to attend, even a stranger who should happen to be
staying in the neighbourhood at the time, but it was an understood
thing that every person who did attend, whether male or female,
contributed something, however small, in order to make a purse for the
young couple, who, on the other hand, naturally expected donations from
those whose weddings they had attended themselves. So it was to the
advantage of the bride and bridegroom-elect to make their wedding as
public as possible, as the greater the number of guests, the greater
the donation, so it was the custom to send the &ldquo;Gwahoddwr,&rdquo;
or Bidder all round the surrounding districts to invite the neighbours
and friends about three weeks, more or less, before the wedding took
place. The banns were, of course, published as in England.</p>
<p class="par">The Gwahoddwr or Bidder&rsquo;s circuit was one of the
most pleasant and merry features of the rural weddings in South Wales
in times past, and he was greeted everywhere, especially when it
happened that he was, as such often was the case, a merry wag with
fluent speech and a poet; but it was necessary that he should be a real
friend to the young couple on whose behalf he invited the guests. This
important wedding official as he went from house to house, carried a
staff of office in his hand, a long pole, or a white wand, as a rule a
willow-wand, from which the bark had been peeled off. This white stick
was decorated with coloured ribbons plying at the end of it; his hat
also, and often his breast was gaily decorated in a similar manner.</p>
<p class="par">The Gwahoddwr, thus attired, knocked at the door of each
guest and entered the house amidst the smiles of the old people and the
giggling of the young. Then he would take his stand in the centre of
the house, and strike the floor with his staff to enforce <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>silence,
and announce the wedding, and the names of bride and bridegroom-elect,
their place of abode, and enumerate the great preparations made to
entertain the guests, etc. As a rule, the Gwahoddwr made this
announcement in a set speech of prose, and often repeated a rhyme also
on the occasion.</p>
<p class="par">The following was the speech of a Gwahoddwr in
Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in 1762, quoted in Meyrick&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Cardiganshire,&rdquo; from the miscellaneous papers
of Mr. Lewis Morris:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;<i>Speech of the Bidder in Llanbadarn Fawr,
1762.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The intention of the bidder is this; with
kindness and amity, with decency and liberality for Einion Owain and
Llio Ellis, he invites you to come with your good will on the plate;
bring current money; a shilling, or two, or three, or four, or five;
with cheese and butter. We invite the husband and wife, and children,
and man-servants, and maid-servants, from the greatest to the least.
Come there early, you shall have victuals freely, and drink cheap,
stools to sit on, and fish if we can catch them; but if not, hold us
excusable; and they will attend on you when you call upon them in
return. They set out from such a place to such a place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Another well-known Gwahoddwr about 50 years ago
was Thomas Parry, who lived at the small village of Pontshan in the
parish of Llandyssul. A short time ago, when I was staying in that
neighbourhood in quest for materials for my present work, I came across
a few old people who well-remembered him, especially Mr. Thomas Evans,
Gwaralltyryn, and the Rev. T. Thomas, J.P., Greenpark, both of whom, as
well as one or two others, told me a good deal about him.</p>
<p class="par">Like a good many of the Gwahoddwyr or Bidders, he seemed
to have been a most eccentric character, of a ready wit and full of
humour, especially when more or less under the influence of a glass of
ale. Mr. Rees Jones, Pwllffein, a poet of considerable repute in the
Vale of Cletwr, composed for T. Parry, a &ldquo;Can y Gwahoddwr,&rdquo;
or the Bidder&rsquo;s Song, which song in a very short time, became
most popular in that part of Cardiganshire, and the adjoining districts
of Carmarthenshire. This Parry the Bidder, whenever he was sent by
those intending to marry, went from house to house, through the
surrounding districts, proclaiming the particulars, and inviting all to
the Bidding and the Weddings, and he was greeted with smiles wherever
he went, especially by the young men and young women, who always looked
forward to a wedding with great delight, as it was an occasion for so
much merriment and enjoyment, and where lovers and sweethearts met.
Food was set before the Gwahoddwr almost in every house, bread and
cheese and beer, so that it is not to be wondered at that he felt a bit
merry before night. He tramped through his circuit through storms and
rain, but like most Bidders, he was but poorly paid, so he was often
engaged as a mole trapper as well.</p>
<p class="par">On one occasion, he had set down a trap in a
neighbouring field in the evening expecting to find a mole entrapped in
it next morning. Next morning came, and off went the old man to see the
trap, but when he arrived on the spot, to his great surprise, instead
of a mole in the trap, there was a fish in it! The famous entrapper of
moles could not imagine how a fish could get into a trap on dry land,
but he found out afterwards that some mischievous boys had been there
early in the morning before him, who, to have a bit of fun at the
expense of the old man, had taken out the mole from the trap and put a
fish in it instead.</p>
<p class="par">Thus we see that the modern Gwahoddwr was generally a
poor man; but in the old times, on the other hand, he was a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>person of importance, skilled in pedigrees and
family traditions, and himself of good family; for, undoubtedly, these
old wedding customs which have survived in some localities in
Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire and other parts of Wales even down
almost to the present time, are of a very ancient origin, coming down
even from the time of the Druids, and this proves the wisdom and
knowledge of the original legislators of the Celtic tribes; for they
were instituted in order to encourage wedlock so as to increase the
population of the country, and to repair the losses occasioned by
plagues and wars. A chieftain would frequently assume the character of
a Bidder on behalf of his vassal, and hostile clans respected his
person as he went about from castle to castle, or from mansion to
mansion.</p>
<p class="par">Old people who well remember the time when the quaint
old wedding customs were very general throughout West Wales, informed
me that it was in some localities the custom sometimes to have two or
more Gwahoddwyr to invite to the wedding; this was especially the case
when the bride and bridegroom-elect did not reside in the same part of
the country; for it happened sometimes that the young man engaged to be
married lived in a certain part of Carmarthenshire, whilst his bride
perhaps lived some way off in Cardiganshire or Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p class="par">In such cases it was necessary to appoint two Bidders,
one for the young man, and another for the young woman, to go round the
respective districts in which each of them lived.</p>
<p class="par">An old man in Carmarthenshire informed me that many
years ago a friend of his, a farmer in the parish of Llanycrwys married
a young lady from Pencarreg, two Bidders were sent forth to tramp the
country; one going round the parish of Llanycrwys where the bridegroom
lived, and the other&rsquo;s circuit was the parish of Pencarreg, the
native parish of the bride.</p>
<p class="par">Another custom in some places, especially round
Llandyssul and Llangeler, which took place before appointing the
Gwahoddwr, was for the neighbours and friends to come together of an
evening to the house of the bride or bridegroom&rsquo;s parents, or any
other place fixed upon for that purpose. On such occasion a good deal
of drinking home-brewed beer was indulged in, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Er
lles y par ifanc</span>,&rdquo; that is, for the benefit of the young
couple. All the profit made out of this beer drinking at a private
house went to the young man and the young woman as a help to begin
their married life. At such a meeting also very often the day of the
wedding was fixed, and the Bidder appointed, and should he happen to be
an inexperienced one he was urged to repeat his Bidding speech
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>before the company present, in order to test him
whether he had enough wit and humour to perform his office
satisfactorily in going round to invite to the wedding.</p>
<p class="par">When the young people engaged to be married were sons
and daughters of well-to-do farmers, it was the custom to send by this
Bidder in his rounds, a circular letter, or a written note in English;
and this note or circular in course of time became so fashionable that
the occupation of a Bidder gradually fell to decay; that is, it became
a custom to send a circular letter instead of a Bidder. The following
Bidding Letter, which is not a fictitious one, but a real document,
appeared in an interesting book, entitled &ldquo;The Vale of
Towy,&rdquo; published in 1844:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">The day before the Wedding was once allotted to bringing
home the &ldquo;Ystafell,&rdquo; or household goods and furniture, of
the young couple; but these customs varied considerably in different
parts of the country. The furniture of the bride, as a rule, consisted
of a feather bed and bed clothes, one or two large oaken chests to keep
clothes in, and a few other things; and it was customary for the
bridegroom to find or provide tables, chairs, bedstead, and a dresser.
The dresser was perhaps the most interesting relic of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>family
property, and is still to be seen in Welsh farm-houses, and is greatly
valued as a thing which has been an heirloom in the family for
generations. It consists of two or more stages, and the upper
compartments, which are open, are always decked with specimens of
useful and ornamental old Welsh ware, which are getting very rare now,
and people offer a high price for them as curiosities.</p>
<p class="par">It was also customary on the same day for the young man
and the young woman to receive gifts of various kinds, such as money,
flour, cheese, butter, bacon, hens, and sometimes even a cow or a pig,
also a good many useful things for house-keeping. This was called
&ldquo;Pwrs a Gwregys&rdquo;&mdash;a purse and a girdle. But these
gifts were to be re-paid when demanded on similar occasions; and, upon
a refusal, were even recoverable by law; and sometimes this was
done.</p>
<p class="par">About a hundred years ago, and previous to that date,
the day before the wedding, as a rule, was allotted to the
&ldquo;Ystafell,&rdquo; or bringing home of the furniture, etc.; but
more recently it became the custom to appoint a day for that purpose at
other times in some districts, that is, it took place whenever the
young married couple went to live at a house of their own; this would
be perhaps three or six months after the wedding. In Wales it is very
common to see a young married couple among the farmers remaining with
the parents of the young man, or with the young wife&rsquo;s parents
until it is a convenient time for them to take up a farm of their
own.</p>
<p class="par">I have already noticed that these customs varied in
different parts of the country. In some districts, the day preceding
the Wedding was a great time for feasting, whilst in other localities
people came together to drink for the benefit of the young couple, and
when cakes were prepared for the Neithior which was to follow the
wedding on the next day.</p>

<p class="par first">At the present time, Welsh people marry on any day
of the week, but about fifty years ago Wednesday was a favourite day in
some places, and Friday in other places. I am writing more especially,
of course, of West Wales. Indeed, in some parishes old men informed me
that when they were young they did not remember any one marrying,
except on a Friday. This fact, undoubtedly, is likely to surprise many
English readers, who regard Friday as an unlucky day for anything.</p>

"pb29">29</a>]</span>was the day on which most people did marry, except
in a few districts, about three generations ago, as well as in older
times. Whether this day, that is, Saturday, was commonly fixed upon
from a belief that it was a lucky day for marriage, or from the
convenience of Sunday intervening between it and a working day, is
rather difficult to know, but it seems that the following old English
Marrying Rhyme was either unknown to the Welsh, or that they did not
give heed to it:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE HORSE WEDDING.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The rural weddings in South Wales until very
recently were Horse Weddings; that is, it was the custom of the whole
party, both men and women to ride, and generally at full speed. Poor
people generally managed to obtain the loan of horses for the happy
occasion from their richer neighbours. On the wedding morning the
invited guests, both men and women, married and unmarried, came on
their horses and ponies, some of them from a long distance. The men
proceeded to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, about a hundred or a hundred
and fifty in number and honourably paid their pwython; whilst the women
at the same time went to the house of the bride, and paid to her their
pwython.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pwython&rdquo; was the term used in connection
with these weddings to denote the gifts presented to the young bride
and bridegroom respectively, in return for what the invited guests
themselves had received on the occasion of their own weddings from the
young man and the young woman, or their relations or friends. Of
course, a large number of those who gave gifts were young and
unmarried, so that they were not all under an obligation to give; but
still they gave, and they were expected to give to help the young
couple, and by so giving, they were placing the latter under an
obligation to them in the future, that is, in such cases, the giver
gave under the expectation of receiving back gifts of equal value,
whenever his or her own, or one of his or her relations&rsquo; wedding
took place, even should that happen on the very next day.</p>
<p class="par">After depositing their offerings and taking something to
eat, it was then the custom for ten, twelve, or sometimes even twenty
young men, headed by a bard, a harper, or some fluent speaker, to mount
their horses, and drive away full speed in the direction of the
bride&rsquo;s house to demand her in marriage for the bridegroom.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>But on the morning of the wedding, the young
woman, that is, the bride-elect, was not to be got possession of
without much trouble and argument, and searching<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e1346" title="Source: ,">.</span> When the bridegroom&rsquo;s
procession halted at the house of the bride&rsquo;s parents, the leader
of the party, finding the door barred against their entrance, would
formally demand the bride, generally in rhyme appropriate to the
occasion, delivered something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Open windows, open doors,</p>
<p class="line">And with flowers strew the floors;</p>
<p class="line">Heap the hearth with blazing wood,</p>
<p class="line">Load the spit with festal food;</p>
<p class="line">The &ldquo;crochon<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1360src"

<p class="line">And tap a barrel of the best!</p>
<p class="line">For this is Catty&rsquo;s wedding day!</p>
<p class="line">Now bring the fair one out, I pray.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Then one of the bride&rsquo;s party from within
made a reply as follows, with the door still closed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Who are ye all? ye noisy train!</p>
<p class="line">Be ye thieves or honest men?</p>
<p class="line">Tell us now what brings you here,</p>
<p class="line">Or this intrusion will cost you dear?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Then the one from without rejoins:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Honest men are we, who seek</p>
<p class="line">A dainty maid both fair and meek,</p>
<p class="line">Very good and very pretty,</p>
<p class="line">And known to all by name of Catty;</p>
<p class="line">We come to claim her for a bride;</p>
<p class="line">Come, father, let the fair be tied</p>
<p class="line">To him who loves her ever well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The one within again answers:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;So ye say, but time will tell;</p>
<p class="line">My daughter&rsquo;s very well at home</p>
<p class="line">So ye may pack and homeward roam.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Your home no more she&rsquo;s doomed to

<p class="line">Burst in the doors and batter walls,</p>
<p class="line">To rescue her whom wedlock calls.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Another of the bridegroom&rsquo;s party then calls
aloud, in a voice of authority:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ho! peace in the King&rsquo;s name, here,
peace!</p>
<p class="line">Let vaunts and taunting language cease;</p>

<p class="line">The favour to all bridesmen due,</p>
<p class="line">The daughter from the father&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p class="line">And entertainment kindly bland.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The above rhyme appeared in &ldquo;Adventures of
Twm Shon Catty<span class="corr" id="xd24e1450" title=
"Source: :">.</span>&rdquo; There are a good many such verses composed
for, or at such occasion, still extant in the Welsh language.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The party without and the party within feigned to abuse
one another in such rhymes for an hour, more sometimes, till their wit
was exhausted, but the whole performance was nothing but innocent fun,
and the doors are opened in the end, and the bridegroom&rsquo;s party
are admitted into the house; but even then the trouble is not always
over, for it was the custom for the bride to hide herself, when search
would be made for her everywhere under the tables, beds, behind the
doors and every corner in the house, and at last found, perhaps, under
the disguise of a young man smoking his pipe, or of a
&ldquo;granny&rdquo; knitting in the corner.</p>
<p class="par">Whoever discovered the bride received a pint of beer and
a cake as a prize in some places. All these things were done for fun or
amusement, but I heard of one young woman at least, who was hiding in
real earnest, and could not be found.</p>
<p class="par">An old farmer near Carmarthen, Griffiths, of Rhenallt,
who is 96 years of age, informed me about five years ago, that he once
heard his father mention of a man called &ldquo;Dafydd y
Llether,&rdquo; a butcher near Alltwalis, who was disappointed in this
manner. This happened about 100 years ago. This butcher was engaged to
be married to a farmer&rsquo;s daughter who lived in the parish of
Llanllwni, about eight miles off, and had made all preparations for the
wedding. When the wedding morning dawned, Dafydd and his neighbours and
friends, about one hundred in number, mounted their horses at
Alltwalis, and galloped away full speed to Llanllwni, and having
arrived at the house of the young bride&rsquo;s parents, search was
made for her everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. At last the
young man and his friends had to return home without finding her in
great disappointment! The young woman&rsquo;s parents had prevailed
upon her not to marry the young man, &ldquo;because&rdquo; added the
old man to me &ldquo;he was too much of a jolly boy.&rdquo; So they had
contrived between them to hide her where she could not be found on the
wedding morning.</p>
<p class="par">But, to proceed with our account of the old wedding
customs, it was the practice after finding the hidden bride, and
partaking of a little refreshments, for the wedding party to mount
their horses, and they were joined by the bridegroom and his friends,
and made their way towards the church. The young woman was mounted on a
fine and swift horse; but often she had to be content to be mounted
behind her father, or a brother or a friend; and when the latter was
the case, she had to sit on crupper without any pillion, and holding
fast to the man. Then the whole cavalcade would gallop off to church.
But during the procession the bride was seized suddenly by one of her
relatives or friends, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>stolen away and borne off to a distance.
However, this feigned attempt to run away with her was done only in
sport. Then a chase ensued, when the bridegroom and his friends drove
after her like madmen till they caught her and took her to church. The
driving was so furious on such occasions that legs and arms were
sometimes broken. Mr. D. Jones in his interesting Welsh book on the
History of the Parish of Llangeler, says that in the year 1844, at the
wedding of Dinah, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Jones, Saron, one James
Evans, the groom of the late Colonel Lewes, drove so furiously that his
horse struck against a wall with the result that both the animal and
its rider were killed on the spot, near Llangeler Church! In
consequence of such a melancholy event the Horse Wedding was
discontinued in that part of the country, through the influence of the
Vicar, the Rev. John Griffiths, who preached against the practice from
II. Kings, chap. IX. verse 20 ... &ldquo;And the driving is like the
driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi<a id="xd24e1464" name=
"xd24e1464"></a>; for he driveth furiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The following account of a Horse Wedding appeared in
&ldquo;The Folk Lore of North Wales&rdquo; by the late Rev. Elias Owen,
F.S.A., whose informant was the Rev. Canon Griffith Jones, who
witnessed the wedding, which took place at Tregaron, Cardiganshire. We
are told that &ldquo;The friends of both the young people were on
horseback, and according to custom they presented themselves at the
house of the young woman, the one to escort her to the church, and the
other to hinder her from going there. The friends of the young man were
called &ldquo;Gwyr shegouts.&rdquo; When the young lady was mounted,
she was surrounded by the &ldquo;gwyr shegouts,&rdquo; and the
cavalcade started. All went on peaceably until a lane was reached, down
which the lady bolted, and here the struggle commenced, for her friends
dashed between her and her husband&rsquo;s friends and endeavoured to
force them back, and thus assist her to escape. The parties, Mr. Jones
said, rode furiously and madly, and the struggle presented a cavalry
charge, and it was not without much apparent danger that the opposition
was overcome, and the lady ultimately forced to proceed to the church,
where her future husband was anxiously awaiting her arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Lord Bishop of Huron, a native of Cardiganshire,
writing to me from Canada, November 17th., 1909, says:&mdash;&ldquo;I
remember a wedding once when all the guests were on horse-back and
there was a hunt for the bride. There could be no wedding till the
bride was caught, and, Oh the wild gallop over hill and dale till she
was taken captive and led to the altar! The last wedding of that kind
to which I refer took place about 45 years ago. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>daughter
of Mr. Morgan (I think) of Maestir, near Lampeter, or his intended wife
being the bride. A very severe accident happened to the bride and that
ended the custom in that neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Although such things as I have already said were done
for sport, yet I have heard of a few cases in which the bride was borne
away in earnest, and disappeared willingly in company of an old lover
of hers, to the intense astonishment and disappointment of the
bridegroom, who happened to be her parents&rsquo; choice, and not her
own. In this case, the custom of a feigned attempt to run away with the
bride had in some respects served its original purpose; for,
undoubtedly, the origin of the custom of hiding, running away with, and
capturing the bride could be traced back to those barbarous times when
marriage by capture was a common practice. Thus in the Mabinogion, we
find that when a King named Kilydd, after being for some time a
widower, wanted to marry again, one of his counsellors said to him,
&ldquo;I know a wife that will suit thee well, and she is the wife of
King Dogel.&rdquo; And they resolved to go and seek her; and they slew
the King and brought away his wife.<a id="xd24e1475" name=
"xd24e1475"></a> When his son also named Kilhwch wanted a wife, he went
to demand her from her father Yspaddaden Pencawr, the Giant, and
obtained her at last after many adventures, and the help of Arthur and
his men. It is probable that when the Celtic Tribes had settled in
Britain that they often obtained a wife by capturing her from the
Aborigines.</p>
<p class="par">This calls to mind the strategy of Romulus to secure
wives for his soldiers by directing them at a given signal to seize
Sabine maidens and run off with them whilst the men were busy in
looking at the games.</p>
<p class="par">Another singular instance of wife snatching in ancient
times is to be found in the Book of Judges, for when the men of the
tribe of Benjamin were in difficulty in obtaining wives for themselves,
their elders commanded them to &ldquo;go and lie in wait in the
vineyards; and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every
man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of
Benjamin,.... And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
caught.&rdquo; <a class="biblink xd24e50" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jdg%2021:20-23">Judges
XXI., verses 20, 21, and 23</a>.</p>
<p class="par">It seems that some kind of Horse Weddings is in vogue
among the Calmucians, even at the present day, the young woman is first
mounted on her horse and drives off full speed, then the young man, who
is her intended, mounts and chases her, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>when he
catches her he can claim her as his wife on the spot; but should she
escape him, he cannot claim her. I well remember when I lived in the
Welsh Colony of Patagonia, about 20 years ago, that it was a very
common custom for a young man and a young woman when in love, to mount
their steeds and take a long ride of 20 miles or more in each
other&rsquo;s company, and whilst driving along together in such manner
words of love were often whispered. Also when a wedding took place, the
guests went to it on their horses, but the old custom of driving after,
and capturing the bride was not observed.</p>
<p class="par">Horse Weddings were very general in West Wales about
sixty years ago, and even twenty years ago in some districts, but I
doubt whether the custom has been continued at the present day in any
part of the country. In the chase after the bride it was supposed that
whoever caught her would be married without doubt within a year from
that date, so it is not to be wondered at that young men drove so
furiously on such occasions.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as the marriage ceremony was over in church, it
was once the custom for a harper in the churchyard to play &ldquo;Merch
Megan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mentra Gwen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morwynion Glan
Meirionydd,&rdquo; or some other beautiful old Welsh Air appropriate to
the occasion.</p>
<p class="par">It was also customary in some places, especially in the
Northern part of Cardiganshire, for a certain number of young men to
mount their steeds immediately after the ceremony, and drive off full
speed, for the first who reached the house of the newly-married couple
was to receive a quart of beer and a silk pocket handkerchief,
especially if the young husband and wife were well-to-do.</p>
<p class="par">The ceremony at the Church being over, all the company
joined and returned to the young couple&rsquo;s house, where dinner was
provided. On their return journey again, as in going to Church, they
drove fast. Indeed, it was often the custom to have a regular horse
race on the way home from Church on the wedding day.</p>
<p class="par">The Rev. D. G. Williams gives the following amusing
story of such a race, in connection with a rural wedding which took
place not far from Newcastle Emlyn. There lived a genial old country
gentleman in the north-eastern part of Pembrokeshire, known as Mr.
Howells, Glaspant, who had sent three of his horses to the wedding
referred to, one of them was a pony, considered among the swiftest in
the district; but there was one drawback in connection with the animal.
He would go whichever way he pleased, especially when he was excited.
The wedding procession <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>went along from a house called Gilfach
Gweision to Capel Evan, where the &ldquo;knot was tied,&rdquo; and as
soon as the ceremony was over the homeward race began in real earnest.
The Squire felt confident that his &ldquo;Comet,&rdquo; as the pony was
named, would be sure to prove victorious in the race, if the animal
could be kept to follow the road which led on to Cwm Cuch, instead of
turning to another road which led to Mr. Howells&rsquo; own house,
Glaspant. To make sure of this, the enthusiastic old gentleman in due
time, sent all his servants, both men and women, with walking-sticks
and brooms in their hands to stand where the two roads met, so as to
prevent the pony turning to the one that led to the house. Onward came
the wedding cavalcade at last, the pony taking the lead as Mr. Howells
expected, and when &ldquo;Comet&rdquo; saw a rowdy crowd shouting with
all their might, and with brooms and sticks, the animal was glad to
pass forward in the right direction and soon proved himself the hero of
the day, and the old man felt as proud of his pony as the young husband
was of his wife.</p>
<p class="par">Another common practice in connection with the weddings
in Wales, and still prevails in some places, was known as Chaining or
Halting the Wedding. As the young husband and wife were driving home
from Church at the end of the wedding ceremony they would find the way
obstructed by ropes stretching the road, covered with flowers, and
ribbons, and evergreens, or sometimes blocked up entirely by thorns. It
is said that this was intended as the first obstacle in married life.
Ropes in some cases were made of straw, and the young couple were not
allowed to pass without paying a footing to the obstructors, and then
the barrier was removed amidst a general hurrah. This chaining or
halting the wedding was known in many parts of West Wales as
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">codi cwinten</span>,&rdquo; or to set up a
quintain.</p>
<p class="par">In ancient times Guintain seems to have been some kind
of a game of skill in vogue among several nations; it consisted of an
upright post, on the top of which a cross bar turned on a pivot;
&ldquo;at one end of the cross hung a heavy sand bag, and at the other
was placed a broad plank; the accomplished cavalier in his passage
couched his lance, and with the point made a thrust at the broad plank,
and continued his route with his usual rapidity, and only felt the
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">gwyntyn</span>,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;air&rdquo;
of the sand bag, fanning his hair as he passed.... The awkward horseman
in attempting to pass this terrific barrier was either unhorsed by the
weight of the sand bag, or by the impulse of the animal against the bar
found his steed sprawling under him on the ground.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In some parts of the country, when the bride or the
young wife reaches home after the wedding ceremony, she buys some small
trifle, a pin or anything from her bridesmaid; and by taking the
opportunity of buying something before her husband has a chance,
she&rsquo;ll be master over him for life! Sometimes the young
newly-married couple resorted to a Wishing Well, and the first to drink
the water became the master in their wedded life!</p>
<p class="par">In Wales, it is considered unlucky to marry on a wet
day. It was considered unlucky for the wedding party to go and return
from the church exactly on the same path, so sometimes it was customary
to go out of the way a bit so as to avoid ill-luck.</p>
<p class="par">It is still customary to decorate the roads where the
wedding party is to pass with arches and bannerettes, bearing mottoes
appropriate to the occasion. This was done in February, 1906, at the
wedding of Mr. David T. Davies, of Penlan, Llanwrda; and at the
marriage of Mr. D. Barlett of Carmarthen in the same month, Llanboidy
Parish Church was tastefully decorated with palms and evergreens, and
the village was gay with bunting and festoons. Such decorations are
very common, especially in connection with a country gentleman&rsquo;s
marriage, when tenants adorn their houses with garlands, and children
strew flowers in the bride&rsquo;s path. It was formerly the custom to
pelt the bride and bridegroom with flowers, and it is still very
general to throw rice at them. I remember this rice-throwing three
years ago at Llanilar, Cardiganshire, at the wedding of a sister of Dr.
Rees. Sometimes old boots were thrown, and I have heard that grains of
wheat served the purpose once. Such things were done to ensure
&ldquo;Good Luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In former times the bridal flowers were roses, gentle
lady, lady&rsquo;s fingers, lady-smock, pansy, prickles and furze, and,
in order to encourage the young wife in industry, red clover bloom was
strewn in her pathway.</p>

<h3 class="main">NEITHIOR.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the ceremony at the church and the horse
racing which followed were over, the guests proceeded to the young
married couple&rsquo;s house to partake of some food, and in the
afternoon and the evening they paid their &ldquo;pwython&rdquo; to the
newly married couple, that is those of the guests who had not paid
already. Others again gave fresh presents. There was much consumption
of beer and cakes on such occasions always, and the sale of which was a
further source of income to the young couple, so that between
everything they were provided with the means for a good start in their
married life. Very often such a large <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>crowd attended the
Neithior, that the house was often too small to accommodate them all;
so a party of the men resorted to the barn or any other convenient
place to drink beer.</p>
<p class="par">It was also customary for the young men to treat the
young maidens with cakes; so there was a good deal of love-making, and
often of rivalry, especially should there be a very pretty girl among
the merry company. Those young maids who were fortunate enough as to be
in favour with the young men had their aprons full of cakes and
biscuits, etc., to take home with them in the evening. Such festivities
as a rule were very merry and kept up till a late hour, and there was a
good deal of singing, harp-playing and dancing, for the Welsh were
expert dancers in former times; but at the present day dancing is
almost unknown, at least in country places.</p>
<p class="par">On such occasions, it was customary, as a rule, to
secure the presence of a harper, for the harp was from time immemorial
a favourite musical instrument among the Welsh people; for Giraldus
Cambrensis writing 700 years ago, says:&mdash;&ldquo;Those who arrive
in the morning are entertained till evening with the conversation of
young women and the music of the harp; for each house has its young
women and harps allotted to this purpose ... and in each family the art
of playing on the harp is held preferable to any other learning.&rdquo;
During the last three generations, however, the dear old instrument
with its sweet and melodious sounds gradually declined in popular
favour in Wales, and at the present, there are but very few who can
play on the harp at all, indeed, in many districts the instrument has
entirely disappeared, giving place to the modern piano. This is to be
greatly regretted, and every patriotic Welshman should do his best to
encourage playing on the harp.</p>
<p class="par">It happened once that a &ldquo;Neithior&rdquo; or
wedding festivities took place, strange to say, without a
wedding!<a id="xd24e1533" name="xd24e1533"></a> This was about two
generations ago in the Parish of Llandyssul. A man of the name of B. T.
Rees, in that part of the country was engaged to be married to a young
woman who was known as Sally. Two Bidders had been sent round the
country to invite people to the wedding, and all other preparations had
been made ready for the joyful occasion, and everything appeared most
promising. But when B. T. Rees, a few days before the appointed time
for the wedding ceremony, went to visit his bride-elect, she would
neither receive him nor speak to him, but ordered him to depart
immediately from her presence, to the great astonishment and
disappointment of Rees, the bridegroom, and his friends. He endeavoured
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>to reason with her, but to no purpose. Afterwards
some of his friends were sent to speak to her, but nothing availed; it
seemed as if she had suddenly made up her mind to banish him entirely
from her heart.</p>
<p class="par">The wedding was to take place at Henllan on a certain
morning, and the &ldquo;Neithior&rdquo; in the afternoon at Llandyssul.
When that morning arrived, the bridegroom and his friends, decided to
seek the bride once more, but she had hidden herself and could not be
found anywhere. Rees and his party were in a strange predicament, and
did not know what to do; but they returned to Llandyssul, and in the
afternoon the wedding festivities were kept up just as if the wedding
had actually taken place; and when night came, Rees had come into
possession of large sums of money from the sale of beer, and donations,
or wedding gifts and the sincere sympathy of the guests, but he had
failed to secure a wife after all! Rees and Sally were married
ultimately, however.</p>
<p class="par">In the last century, the Neithior took place on the
wedding day; in former times, however, the festivities were continued
on the Sunday, which followed. Sir S. R. Meyrick, writing about one
hundred years ago says:&mdash;&ldquo;Sunday being come, the bride and
bridegroom&rsquo;s business is to stay at home all day and receive
good-will and pwython. This is called &ldquo;Neithior.&rdquo; They
receive more money this day than Saturday, and all are written down as
before, whether fresh presents, or those repaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It seems from what I have been informed by old persons,
that such doings on Sundays had almost disappeared, if not completely
so, in Meyrick&rsquo;s time, at least in most places, but it is evident
that Sunday observances of the kind were common about the middle of the
eighteenth century; and in the old Church Register of the parish of
Llanfihangel Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn, in Cardiganshire, the following record
is found:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;11 June, 1745. Whereas the parish has been
notorious hitherto in upholding and continuing a wicked custom of
keeping Biddings or meetings upon the Sabbath day to the dishonour of
God, and contempt of religion, to prevent such irregularities for the
future, it is this day ordered by the consent of a vestry legally
called and kept that the said custom shall stop and be discontinued
entirely hereafter, and whosoever within our said parish encourages or
practices and obstinately refuses to obey this our order, we do
unanimously consent and join to punish him to the utmost rigour of the
law.&mdash;W. Williams, Clerk, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Such Sunday customs were by degrees discontinued
entirely in every part of Wales, and the Welsh have been for some
generations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>now, and to their credit still are, the most
strict Sabbatarians in the world with the exception perhaps of the
Scotch. The Methodists Revivalists in the eighteenth century, who
greatly inveighed against Sabbath breaking, contributed towards
bringing about this satisfactory state of things.</p>
<p class="par">The curious old Welsh Weddings, which I have endeavoured
to describe in this book do not prevail now; the only surviving feature
of them is perhaps what is known in some parts as
&ldquo;Ystafell,&rdquo; and in other parts as &ldquo;Cwyro Ty.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ystafell&rdquo; is rather popular now in some districts,
especially between Tregaron and Lampeter, but instead of a Gwahoddwr or
Bidder an aunt or some other near relative of the bride goes round the
houses inviting the neighbours to bring wedding gifts so as to give the
young couple a good start in life.</p>
<p class="par">I have been informed that similar old wedding customs to
those of the Welsh were once in vogue in Cumberland, a county where the
Celtic element is very strong, and also in Brittany, another Celtic
province, and the present custom of wedding gifts which is so common in
connection with fashionable weddings at the present day, is only a
survival of the old Welsh customs.</p>
<p class="par">It seems that in China also it is customary for the
friends and relations of the bride and bridegroom to present them with
wedding gifts, and in Ancient Peru a dwelling was got ready for the
newly-married pair at the charge of the district, and the prescribed
portion of land assigned for their maintenance, and the ceremony of
marriage was followed by general festivities among the friends of the
parties, which lasted several days.</p>

<p class="par xd24e1561"><span class="xd24e1561init">A</span>s the
Wedding Customs differed, the Funeral Customs also differed, and still
differ in many respects in Wales from those of England. In Wales
funerals are public, and the day and the hour on which they are to take
place are always announced both in church and chapel, and in some
places the day was made known by sending a man or a woman round the
houses. One or two from almost every house in the neighbourhood in
which the deceased lived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>attend his funeral, so that funeral
processions are very large, even in districts where the population is
small and scattered. Both men and women come, many of them from a long
distance, the majority of them on foot, others in their traps, and some
on horses, and even wet and stormy weather does not prevent them, for
they have a profound reverence for the dead and death from time
immemorial; and the night before the funeral a prayer meeting is held
in the room where the corpse is lying, and pious appeals to Heaven are
made in which strong emotions are expressed, the deceased is referred
to in stirring sentences, and his death made a theme for warning on the
brevity of earthly life, and the importance of the future life of the
soul.</p>
<p class="par">This prayer meeting is called Gwylnos (wake-night), and
it is the only surviving feature of the various customs which were once
in vogue in connection with watching the corpse in the house, or
keeping vigil over the dead.</p>
<p class="par">In Wales in former times when any one died, candles were
always lighted every night in the room where the corpse was, and it was
customary for friends or relatives to sit up all night to watch it, and
even at the present day the custom is observed by some. Some are of the
opinion that this custom had its origin in pre-reformation times. But
it seems more probable to have been a Pagan custom, and much older than
Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">The original design of the lighted candles, undoubtedly,
was to give light to the spirit of the dead on its way to the other
world. This is done for that purpose at the present day in China.</p>
<p class="par">It was once the custom in some parts to open the windows
when a person was dying. Principal Sir John Rhys, Oxford, says that he
well remembers this done in the neighbourhood of Ponterwyd, in North
Cardiganshire, and that a farmer near Ystrad Meurig, in the same
county, informed him that when his mother (the farmer&rsquo;s) was
dying, a neighbour&rsquo;s wife who had been acting as nurse tried to
open the window of the room, and as it would not open, she deliberately
smashed a pane of it; and the learned Professor remarks that
&ldquo;this was doubtless originally meant to facilitate the escape of
the soul.&rdquo;&mdash;Celtic Folk-Lore.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary in the neighbourhood of
Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, to cover with muslin the looking glass in
the room in which the corpse lay. But to return to the Wake Night, or
keeping vigil over the dead, I have already mentioned that the only
feature of the old customs in connection with it still observed is the
Prayer Meeting on the night before the funeral, and even this has been
almost discontinued in Pembrokeshire, though still <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>popular
in Cardiganshire and parts of Carmarthenshire, but the custom is very
injurious to the health of those who attend these meetings, as people
crowd together in large numbers into the room&mdash;often a small
one&mdash;where the coffin is. It was once the custom for every person
on entering the house to fall devoutly on his knees before the corpse,
and repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, or some other prayer, and then a
pipe and tobacco were offered to him, but is not done now; but it was
done in former times in many districts before the commencement of the
prayer meeting.</p>
<p class="par">The manner of conducting this prayer meeting also
differs at the present day to what it used to be once. In former times,
before the Nonconformists became strong in Wales, it was the custom for
the clergyman to read the common service appointed for the burial of
the dead, and at the conclusion of which Psalms were sung; but at the
present day the custom is, as a rule, for three or four persons to
offer extemporary prayers, and an address delivered on the melancholy
subject by the Clergyman of the Church of England or a Nonconformist
minister, and hymns are sung. And afterwards the crowd depart for their
homes.</p>
<p class="par">Formerly when it was customary to keep vigil over the
dead, young men and women were glad to volunteer their services to
watch the corpse during the night in order to enjoy the society of each
other, and on some occasions, it seems, from what I have been told by
old persons, some of the young men were rather merry before morning,
and often went as far as to drink beer, and in order to pass the time
good many stories were related about Corpse Candles, phantom funerals,
etc., but the old Welsh Wake nights were never so rowdy as the Irish
ones.</p>
<p class="par">In Pembrokeshire, about hundred and fifty years ago
there was a most curious, strange, and mysterious custom performed
during the Wake Night, known as &ldquo;Hir-wen-gwd&rdquo; (long white
bag, or shroud). The corpse was drawn up through the chimney, and the
process was as follows:&mdash;A certain number of young men took out
the corpse from the coffin and moved it, clad in a long white shroud,
to a convenient place near the fire. Then a rope was tied round to the
upper part of the body, and when this was done securely, the other end
of the rope was passed up the chimney by means of a long stick for that
purpose; and the next step was for a party of the men to go up to the
top of the chimney from the outside of the house by means of a ladder,
and take hold of the rope which had been sent up inside, and when they
were ready for the ceremony, they gave a sign to those who were inside
the house with the corpse, by crying in Welsh,
&ldquo;Hirwen-gwd,&rdquo; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>those who were inside the house would
answer by saying, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Chware&rsquo;n
barod</span>,&rdquo; or we are ready. Then the party who were on top of
the house pulled up the corpse slowly through the chimney by means of
the rope, and brought it to the very top and lowered it again, and
eventually re-placed it in the coffin. An aged person, named Mrs. Mary
Thomas, Bengal, near Fishguard, told me that she had heard a good deal
from her mother about this strange old custom,
&ldquo;Hirwen-gwd,&rdquo; and that the last of such ceremonies took
place at a house called Pantycnwch, in the parish of Bridell, about a
hundred and forty years ago. According to Mrs. Thomas, it was customary
to put a living man in the coffin whilst the ceremony of drawing up the
corpse through the chimney was going on, and this was done in the case
referred to at Bridell; but when the party at the end of the game
approached the coffin in order to take out the living man so as to
replace the corpse in it, they found him dead. This sad incident caused
people after this to put an end of the old custom. When in
Pembrokeshire, I enquired everywhere from very old persons as to the
origin and object of such strange and mysterious ceremony, and in reply
some of them informed me that it was only a game indulged in by those
who were keeping vigil over the dead, to pass the time, whilst others
said that there was once a superstition that another death would soon
follow the funeral in the family or in the district unless the ceremony
was duly performed. Hirwen-gwd, whatever might have been the origin of
it, seems to have been confined to Pembrokeshire, at least I have not
found any tradition of the custom among the old people of Cardiganshire
and Carmarthenshire, except in one district in the latter county,
situated on the very border of Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p class="par">It is, however, possible that such custom was once known
in other parts of South Wales, but discontinued at an earlier date.</p>
<p class="par">In a series of spurious letters, known as
&ldquo;Llythyrau Anna Beynon,&rdquo; bearing the date 1720, and
pretending to give an account of the old rural customs of two hundred
years ago in the Parish of Llandyssul and the surrounding districts, I
found the following strange story in connection with
&ldquo;Hirwen-gwd,&rdquo; but I cannot vouch for the truth of the
account, as it is evident that the &ldquo;letters&rdquo; referred to
are not authentic:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">It seems that many strange and mysterious events took
place sometimes at the Wake-nights in Pembrokeshire, if all the stories
we hear are true. Miss Martha Davies, Fishguard, informed me that her
late uncle, Mr. Howells, Cilgwyn, vouched for the truth of the
following account of an event which happened about a hundred years ago
or more. Saith she:&mdash;An old gentleman farmer, who was a notorious
ungodly man, lived at a farmhouse called Dolgaranog, in North
Pembrokeshire. He at last died, and was placed in his coffin, and the
candles were lighted, and people came together to the house and the
&lsquo;gwylnos,&rsquo; or wake-night went on in the usual manner,
according to the customs of those days. Some of the young men and young
maidens were talking together, whispering words of love to each other,
and were rather merry, it seems. As these things went on, they were
suddenly surprised by hearing the sound of horses&rsquo; feet, as if a
large concourse of people were approaching the house on horses and
driving full speed. The next moment the sound of men&rsquo;s footsteps
was heard entering in through the door and into the very room where the
wakenight went on; but nothing could be seen.</p>
<p class="par">The invisible intruders, as they passed into the room
where the dead man lay, put out all the candles. At last the same sound
of footsteps could be heard departing from the house, and as this
mysterious sound passed out through the room, people heard the bustle,
and even felt the crush, and on leaving, the strange visitors
re-lighted the candles, but nothing was to be seen, but the sound of
horses&rsquo; feet was heard as if a large concourse of cavaliers were
driving away from the house, in the same manner as they had approached
it, and gradually the sound died away. Then the relatives and friends
and others who were present at the &lsquo;gwylnos,&rsquo; keeping vigil
over the dead, were anxious to know what this sound of invisible
footsteps meant, and what had happened, so they entered the room where
the coffin was, and when they opened it, to their great alarm, they
found that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>nothing but an empty coffin, for the corpse was
gone, and was never found again. The people of the neighbourhood really
believed that the body was taken by the Devil, or evil spirits, as the
man had lived such a bad life. The coffin was afterwards filled with
stones and buried.</p>
<p class="par">Another strange old death custom, if it ever existed,
was the &ldquo;Sin Eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It seems that the first to refer to the subject was Mr.
John Aubrey, in 1686, who asserted that there was such a custom in
Herefordshire and also in North Wales, and at the annual meeting of the
Cambrian Arch&aelig;ological Association, which was held at Ludlow in
August, 1852, Mr. Matthew Moggridge, of Swansea, made the following
observation:&mdash;&ldquo;When a person died, his friends sent for the
Sin-eater of the district, who, on his arrival, placed a plate of salt
on the breast of the defunct, and upon the salt a piece of bread. He
then muttered an incantation over the bread, which he finally ate,
thereby eating up all the sins of the deceased. This done, he received
his fee of 2s. 6d. and vanished as quickly as possible from the general
gaze; for, as it was believed that he really appropriated to his own
use and behoof the sins of all those over whom he performed the above
ceremony. He was utterly detested in the neighbourhood&mdash;regarded
as a mere Pariah&mdash;as one irredeemably lost.&rdquo; The speaker
then mentioned the Parish of Llandebie, in Carmarthenshire, where the
above practice was said to have prevailed to a recent period. Mr.
Allen, of Pembrokeshire, said that the plate and salt were known in
that county, where also a lighted candle was stuck in the salt, and
that the popular notion was that it kept away the evil spirit.</p>
<p class="par">A few years ago, one Rhys read at Tregaron an
interesting paper on that town and district, and after referring to the
custom of keeping vigil over the dead, he makes the following
statement: &ldquo;There was also an old custom in the town (Tregaron)
connected with the &lsquo;Sin-eater.&rsquo; Where there was a corpse in
the house the &lsquo;Sin-eater&rsquo; was invited. The relatives of the
dead prepared him a meal on the coffin, he was supposed to eat the sins
of the dead man so as to make the deceased&rsquo;s journey upward
lighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The late Chancellor D. Silvan Evans, and other
well-informed Welshmen, have denied that any such custom as that of the
Sin-eater ever existed in Wales, and Wirt Sikes, after diligent
searching, failed to find any direct corroboration of it, and I may add
that, though I venture no opinion of my own upon the subject, I have
never come across in any part of Wales any old persons, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>either
men or women, who had heard any tradition about it. On the other hand,
the celebrated Welsh Novelist, Allen Raine, informed me a short time
ago, that she knew a man at Carmarthen who had seen a
&ldquo;Sin-eater&rdquo;; and the Rev. G. Eyre Evans showed me a
portrait of a man that had seen one long ago in the Parish of
Llanwenog.</p>
<p class="par">Perhaps the following, which appeared in Volume 15 of
&ldquo;Folk Lore,&rdquo; may prove of interest in connection with the
subject. The writer, Mr. Rendel Harries, who had visited Archag, an
<span class="corr" id="xd24e1732" title=
"Source: Armenial">Armenian</span> village, where he attended service,
says as follows in his &ldquo;Notes from Armenia:&mdash;&ldquo;At the
evening service, to my great surprise, I found that when the
congregation dispersed, a corpse laid out for burial was lying in the
midst of the building. It had, in fact, been brought in before we came,
and was to lie in the Church in preparation for burial next day. I
noticed that two large flat loaves of bread had been placed upon the
body. Inquiry as to the meaning of this elicited no other explanation
than that the bread was for the Church mice and to keep them from
eating the corpse. I did not feel satisfied with the explanation. Some
months later, on mentioning the incident to some intelligent Armenians
in Constantinople, they frankly admitted that in former days the custom
was to eat the bread, dividing it up amongst the friends of the
deceased. Whether this is a case of Sin-eating, I leave Mr. Frazer and
Mr. Hartland to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The question of the alleged Sin-eater in Wales and the
Borders has several times been discussed in &ldquo;Bye-Gones,&rdquo;
Oswestry, and whether there was at any time such strange custom in
vogue in the country, there are at least ample proofs that it was
customary in Pembrokeshire, if not in other parts of the country, to
place a plate of salt on the breast of the corpse, and it was believed
by some that this kept the body from swelling, and by others that it
kept away the evil spirits.</p>
<p class="par">Pennant, a very keen observer, noticed a similar custom
in the Highlands of Scotland 140 years ago, where &ldquo;the friends
lay on the breast of the deceased a wooden platter containing a small
quantity of salt and earth separately and unmixed; the earth an emblem
of the corruptible body; the salt an emblem of the immortal
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There are several superstitions in West Wales concerning
salt, but shall refer to the subject in another chapter.</p>
<p class="par">It was once the custom in Wales to make the sign of the
cross on the dead body or a cross was placed at or near his head; and
though the ceremony was discontinued long ago, we even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>now
occasionally hear the old saying, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Mae e dan ei
grwys</span>&rdquo; (he is under his cross), when a dead body is in the
house.</p>
<p class="par">As a rule in West Wales, coffins are made of oak, but
poor people are satisfied with elm, and the corpse is placed in it,
covered in a white shroud, but good many are buried in their best
clothes, both at present and in the past, and a writer in
&ldquo;Bye-Gones,&rdquo; 1888, says that in an old book in Tregaron
Vestry, dated 1636, he found that it was the rule of the Parish at that
time to bury paupers without a coffin, and they were to wear their best
apparel, and best hat; the charge for burial was two-pence; if any were
buried in a coffin they also were to don their Sunday best, and the
charge for their burial was 2s. 6d.<a id="xd24e1751" name=
"xd24e1751"></a></p>
<p class="par">To bury the dead in their best clothes instead of a
shroud is a custom that has been continued in Wales till the present
day by some, but not without a coffin; but it seems to have been a
common practice to bury paupers, and those who were in <a id=
"xd24e1755" name="xd24e1755"></a>very poor circumstances, without a
coffin till about 200 years ago and even at a later date, as the
registers of some of the old Parish Churches prove. It was also
customary in former times to &ldquo;bury in woollen&rdquo;&mdash;that
is, in a shroud made of woollen material, and the eminent Antiquarian,
Mr. John Davies, of the National Library, has found out &ldquo;that
this was the practice in the Parish of Llandyssul in the year 1722.
Undoubtedly, burying in woollen was in vogue for some generations and a
statute of the time of Queen Elizabeth provided that it should be done
in order to encourage the flannel industry; and an Act of Parliament
was passed in the reign of Charles the Second to promote the sale and
use of English wool, and there was once a penalty of &pound;5 for
burying in a shroud not made of wool.</p>
<p class="par">On the appointed day for the funeral, a large concourse
of friends and neighbours come together at the house of the deceased,
and all are welcomed to partake of food, as the Welsh people have
always been remarkable for their hospitality on melancholy as well as
joyful occasions.</p>
<p class="par">In former times great preparations were made, for the
day of the funeral was in reality a regular feasting day for those who
attended. Meyrick, in his &ldquo;History of Cardiganshire,&rdquo;
writing about a hundred years ago, observes:&mdash;&ldquo;A profuse
dinner, consisting principally of cold meat, fowls, tongues, etc., is
spread on several tables, and a carver placed at the head of each,
whose sole business is to carve for different parties as they
alternately sit down. As the company are too numerous to be all
accommodated within, the poorer people are seated on stools round the
outside <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>of the house, and are presented with cakes and
warmed ale, with spice and sugar in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary to prepare a special kind of drink
known as a &ldquo;diod ebilon,&rdquo; which contained the juice of
elder tree and Rosemary, in addition to the ordinary substances of ale.
The custom of giving beer and cake at funerals continued in some
districts till very recently, and the Rev. D. G. Williams, St.
Clear&rsquo;s, says that this was done at the funeral of an old
gentleman farmer in the Parish of Trelech, in Carmarthenshire, about 30
years ago. Though it is not customary to give beer at the present day,
but food, especially in a way of tea and cake, is given to everybody in
rural districts, not only to those who have come from a distance, but
even to near neighbours. The nearest relations make it a point of
sitting in the death chamber, and before the coffin is nailed up,
almost everybody present in the house enters the room to see the body
and look on it with a sigh. Then Divine Service is conducted, at the
close of which, the body is borne out of the house, by the nearest male
relatives of the deceased, a custom introduced, undoubtedly, into Wales
by the &ldquo;Romans during their residence in this country, for the
coffins of Roman citizens held in high esteem were borne by senators,
but those of enemies were borne on the other hand by slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">According to Pennant&rsquo;s Tours in North Wales, there
was formerly an old custom to distribute bread and cheese over the
coffin to poor people who had been gathering flowers to decorate it.
Sometimes a loaf of bread was given or a cheese with a piece of money
placed inside it, and a cup of drink also was presented. Cakes were
given in South Cardiganshire to those who attended the funerals of the
wealthy.</p>
<p class="par">I found that in Pembrokeshire in the present day, it is
customary to place the coffin on chairs before the door outside before
placing it on a bier. In most districts of West Wales, hearses have
been until a few years ago, almost unknown, and such is the case even
at the present day with few exceptions, except in those places
adjoining the towns, but no doubt they are continually becoming more
general every day. It is still the custom, especially in out of the way
places where the funeral procession wends its way graveward on foot, to
bear the corpse alternately, four men at the time, and sometimes even
women carry as well as men.</p>
<p class="par">In the old times when the roads were bad, especially in
the mountainous parts of the country, it was customary to make use of a
what was known as &ldquo;elorfarch&rdquo; (horse-bier). The elorfarch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>was carried by horses, and it consisted of two
long arms or shafts into which the horses were placed, with transverse
pieces of wood in the centre, on which the coffin was placed.</p>
<p class="par">Before the funeral procession leaves the house, a hymn
is sung, and in former times it was customary to sing on the way,
especially when passing a house, and sometimes the singing continued
all the way from the house to the churchyard without ceasing; and this
singing along the lanes was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful of
all the old Welsh funeral customs, and it is a pity that it has been
discontinued.</p>
<p class="par">During my recent visit to St. David&rsquo;s, an old
gentleman named Evans informed me that he well remembered the funeral
processions singing on the way to the churchyard of St. David&rsquo;s
Cathedral; and that it was also the custom to march round the old stone
cross, which I noticed in the centre of the town, before entering the
churchyard.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd24e1779width"><img src="images/p049.jpg" alt=

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When a funeral takes place at Aberystwyth, in
Cardiganshire, it is customary for the Town Crier to go through the
streets tolling a small hand-bell, a short time before the funeral
procession. This is a survival of a very ancient custom which was once
very general throughout Wales, and in pre-Reformation times this
corpse-bell which was known as &ldquo;bangu,&rdquo; was kept in all the
Welsh Churches, and when a funeral was to take place, the bellman took
it to the house of the deceased. When the procession began, a psalm was
sung, and then the sexton sounded his bell in a solemn manner for some
time, and again at intervals, till the funeral arrived at the Church.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Giraldus Cambrensis, writing 700 years ago, mentions of
such bell at &ldquo;Elevein, in the Church of Glascwm, in Radnorshire;
a portable bell endowed with great virtue, called Bangu, and said to
have belonged to St. David. A certain woman secretly conveyed this bell
to her husband who was confined in his Castle of Raidergwy
(Rhaiadyrgwy) near Warthreinion (which Rhys, son of Gruffyth, had
lately built), for the purpose of his deliverance.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e1789" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The keepers of the Castle not only
refused to liberate him for this consideration, but seized and detained
the bell; and in the same night, by divine vengeance, the whole town,
except the wall on which the bell hung, was consumed by
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Formerly, in all parts of Wales, the Passing Bell was
tolled for the dying, just as the spirit left the body. In ancient
times there was a superstition among the Welsh people that the evil
spirits were hovering about the sick man&rsquo;s chamber, waiting to
pounce upon the soul as it left the body, but that the sound of a bell
frightened away the fiends.</p>
<p class="par">According to &ldquo;Cymru Fu,&rdquo; an interesting
Welsh book published by Hughes and Son, Wrexham, another old custom in
connection with Welsh funerals in former times, was to set down the
bier and kneel and repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, whenever the
procession came to a cross road. The origin of this custom, as given by
the Welsh, is to be found in the former practice of burying criminals
at cross-roads. It was believed that the spirits of these criminals did
not go far away from the place where their bodies lay, and in repeating
the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer was supposed to destroy and do away with any
evil influence these spirits might have on the soul of the dear
departed.</p>
<p class="par">The Venerable Archdeacon Williams, Aberystwyth, informed
me that he was told by the late Principal Edwards, University College
of Wales, that there was once an old custom in the Parish of Llanddewi
Brefi for funeral processions to pass through a bog instead of
proceeding along the road which went round it. Those who bore the bier
through the bog, proceeded with much difficulty and often sank in the
mud. The ceremony of taking the corpse through the bog was, at least,
in Pre-Reformation times, supposed to have the effect of lessening the
time or suffering of the deceased&rsquo;s soul in Purgatory, but the
custom was continued in the said Parish for many generations after the
Reformation, if not until recent times.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary at Rhayader, in Radnorshire, for
funeral processions to carry small stones which were thrown to a large
heap at a particular spot before arriving at the church. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When the funeral procession was nearing the churchyard a
hymn was again sung. The custom was, and still is, for the clergyman,
arrayed in his surplice, to meet the corpse at the entrance of the
churchyard, as directed in the Prayer Book, and placing himself at the
head of the procession, they proceed into the body of the church, and
the bier is placed before the Altar. It was once customary for all the
relations of the deceased to kneel around it until taken from the
church to the place of interment. After the body has been lowered into
the grave, and at the close of the funeral service one or more hymns
are sung, generally those that were favourites of the deceased. When
the deceased who is buried in the churchyard of the Parish Church,
happened to have been a Nonconformist, it is sometimes customary to
have services both in chapel and in church; in the former first, and in
the latter before the interment. This was done in connection with the
funeral of the late Mr. John Evans, Pontfaen, Lampeter, a few years
ago, when I was present myself.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary to give the shoes of the dead man
to the grave-digger, a vestry at Tregaron in Cardiganshire, about 200
years ago passed that this should be done in that place. There is no
such practice at present in any part of Wales. There was once a curious
old custom known as &ldquo;Arian y Rhaw&rdquo; (spade money) which
survived in some districts of West Wales until a comparatively recent
date, especially in the Northern parts of Cardiganshire, and that part
of Carmarthenshire which borders Breconshire.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. John Jones, Pontrhydfendigaid, an old man of 95,
informed me that the custom was observed at Lledrod, a parish situated
about nine miles from Aberystwyth, about eighty years ago. It was
something as follows:&mdash;At the grave, the grave-digger extended his
spade for donations, and received a piece of silver from each one of
the people in turn.</p>
<p class="par">The following account of the custom by an eye-witness
appeared in the Folk-Lore Column of the &ldquo;Carmarthen
Journal,&rdquo; July 7th, 1905:&mdash;&ldquo;It was in the summer of
1887, if I remember well, that I had occasion to attend the funeral of
a young child at Llangurig Church, situated on the main road leading
from Aberystwyth to Llanidloes, and about five miles from the latter.
After the service at the graveyard, the sexton held up an ordinary
shovel into which all present cast something. The cortege was not
large, as the child buried was only eight months old. When all had
contributed their mites, and the sum had been counted, the sexton in an
audible voice, declared the amount received, saying twenty-eight
shillings and sixpence, many thanks to you all.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Another curious old custom at Welsh funerals was the
&ldquo;Offrwm,&rdquo; or Parson&rsquo;s Penny, which was as follows:
After having read the burial service in the Church, the Clergyman stood
near the Altar until the nearest relation went up first to him and
deposited an offertory on the table, then the other mourners, one and
all followed, and presented a piece of money, and the money received by
the Parson in this manner amounted sometimes to a very large sum,
especially when the mourners were wealthy.</p>
<p class="par">The Author of Cradock&rsquo;s account of the most
romantic parts of North Wales, published in 1773, makes the following
observation concerning the custom: &ldquo;Many popish customs are still
retained in Wales; particularly offering made to the dead. These
offerings must, of course, vary according to the rank of the persons
deceased, as well as the affection that is borne to their memories. I
was at a pauper&rsquo;s funeral when the donations amounted to
half-a-crown, and I met with a Clergyman afterwards who had once
received 90 guineas.&rdquo; This has not been practised in Cardigan and
Carmarthenshire within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, but the
custom was observed in former times, we have not the least doubt, and
it has survived even until the present day in some form or other, in
some parts of the Principality, especially in parts of North Wales, as
the following correspondence which appeared in the &ldquo;Oswestry
Advertiser&rdquo; in July, 1906, proves:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">&ldquo;OFFERTORIES AT FUNERALS IN WALES.&rdquo;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;A correspondent in your columns,
about a fortnight ago, called attention to this subject, and expressed
disapproval of the manner in which the offertories are taken in some
Churches at funeral services&mdash;by laying the plate on the bier near
the pulpit, and the congregation in a disorderly manner laying their
offertory on the plate. I regret to observe that this practice is still
pursued in two parishes in this neighbourhood, and I should like to
call the attention of the proper authorities to the desirableness of
changing the custom, and adopting the system suggested by your
correspondent, that the offertory should be taken at the gate, or that
two or more plates should be taken around the congregation. The parish
clerk, too, might be instructed not to announce the amount of the
offertory.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Undoubtedly, this custom has survived from
Pre-Reformation times, and was originally intended to compensate the
Priest for praying for the Soul of the departed in Purgatory, but at
present it only means a token of esteem towards the officiating
Clergyman, or perhaps a tribute of respect to the departed. It was
formerly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>customary in Wales to throw a sprig of rosemary
into the grave on the coffin. The custom has been discontinued now, but
it was done in the Vale of Towy, in Carmarthenshire as late as sixty
years ago.</p>
<p class="par">An excellent old Welsh Magazine, the
&ldquo;Gwyliedydd&rdquo; for May, 1830, makes the following observation
concerning the custom: &ldquo;In ancient times, it was customary for
all who attended a funeral to carry each a sprig of rosemary in his
hand, and throw it into the grave as the minister was reading the last
words of the funeral service&rdquo;; and a writer in the Cambrian
Quarterly Magazine, in the following year adds that a custom analogous
to this prevailed amongst the ancient heathens; who used to throw
cypress wood into the grave in the same manner. The reason why they
made choice of the cypress was, because its branches do not bud when
thrown into the earth, but perish altogether; it was thus an expressive
symbol of their opinion, that the bodies of the dead would never rise
again. On the other hand, the Christians threw the rosemary into the
graves of their brethren to express that hope of a joyful resurrection
with which their faith had inspired them.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary to read the will of deceased over
the grave. Sir S. R. Meyrick mentions this in his History of
Cardiganshire, a hundred years ago, and the custom has been continued
to a more recent date. The Rev. T. D. Thomas, Vicar of Llangorwen, near
Aberystwyth, informed me that this was done by him at Llangadock,
Carmarthenshire, about the year 1897, when officiating in the absence
of the Vicar of that Parish.</p>
<p class="par">There was also an old custom of burying one who had been
murdered, in a coffin covered with red cloth. The Rev. D. G. Williams,
in his collection of Carmarthenshire Folk-Lore, says that one William
Powell, of Glan Areth, Vale of Towy, was so buried in the year
1770.</p>
<p class="par">In Wales in pre-Reformation times, it was sometimes the
practice to bury a rich man in the garments of a monk, as a protection
against evil spirits; but this could not be done without paying large
sums of money to the priests.</p>
<p class="par">The custom of covering the coffin with wreaths is very
generally observed at the present day throughout West and Mid-Wales.
The coffin of the late Sir Pryse Pryse, Bart., Gogerddan, who was
buried at Penrhyncoch, Cardiganshire, April 23rd, 1906, was covered
with wreaths of most beautiful flowers, sent by Dowager Lady Pryse, Sir
Edward and Lady Webley-Parry-Pryse, Countess Lisburne, Viscountess
Parker, Lady Evans, Lovesgrove; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>Mr. and Mrs. Loxdale, and many
other relations and friends, as well as the tenants and servants.</p>
<p class="par">In times past the Welsh always carried the association
of graves and flowers to the most lavish extreme, and Shakespeare,
alluding to this in &ldquo;Cymbeline,&rdquo; the scene of which tragedy
is more especially in Pembrokeshire, says:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd24e1844">&ldquo;Arv. With fairest flowers,</p>
<p class="line">Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,</p>
<p class="line">I&rsquo;ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not
lack</p>
<p class="line">The flower, that&rsquo;s like thy face, pale primrose;
or</p>
<p class="line">The azur&rsquo;d harebell, like thy veins; no, nor</p>
<p class="line">The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,</p>
<p class="line">Outsweeten&rsquo;d not thy breath.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It is more generally the case at the present day
to cover the coffin with wreaths than with loose flowers, and
occasionally the graves are lined with moss and flowers. To decorate
the graves of the departed with flowers is a very old custom amongst
the Welsh, especially on Palm Sunday, which is known in Wales as
&ldquo;Sul y Blodau&rdquo;&mdash;Flowering Sunday. The custom is very
generally observed even at the present day in Glamorganshire, where the
churchyards and other burial places present a very beautiful
appearance; but it is to be regretted that in West Wales, during the
last sixty years, the practice to a very great extent has been
discontinued, at least in rural districts. But it is reviving at the
present day, and likely to grow as years go on. A correspondent from
Aberaeron, in one of the papers noticed that on Palm Sunday, of the
year 1906, many of the graves of Henfynyw, in that district had been
cleaned and flowers placed upon them, whilst on others flowers grew.
Whilst staying for a short time in the Parish of Cilcennin, about five
years ago, I took particular notice, that the planting of flowers and
plants on the graves is renewed every year about Easter or Spring time,
and that they are kept blooming through the loving care of the
descendants of the departed. An old man named Jenkin Williams, a native
of Llangwyryfon, a parish in the same County, who is 89 years of age,
informed me that he well remembered the custom observed in his native
parish, about seven miles from Aberystwyth, many years ago; but it is
rarely observed at the present day. There are many parts of the country
nowadays, where the practice is unknown, but there are evident signs
that the beautiful old custom is reviving in parts of Carmarthenshire,
Cardiganshire, and Pembrokeshire. In Glamorganshire, as I have already
observed, the custom is very general.</p>
<p class="par">The custom of placing tombstones on the graves is very
generally observed, but very few of the stones are in the form of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>a cross. Indeed, crosses are remarkable for their
absence in Welsh Churchyards. The Welsh people in rejecting what they
consider as a too Popish a practice, have gone into the opposite
extremes of adopting as monuments for their dear departed, the
polytheistic obelisk of the ancient Egyptians; the Greek and Roman
urns, and the chest-stone of the Druids. It has been the custom in some
places to whitewash the small inscribed stones at the head and feet of
poor people&rsquo;s graves. Several English authors who have written
about Wales remark that in nearly every churchyard in the country, the
mountain ash is to be seen. It seems to me that this is a mistake; for,
as far as my experience is concerned, it is rarely seen in Welsh
churchyards, at least in the present day, and I have seen a good many
of the churchyards; but it must be admitted that the Welsh have
regarded the tree as sacred, and there are a good many superstitions in
connection with it, so that it is possible that the custom of growing
it in churchyards was more common in former times.</p>
<p class="par">The most common tree in the churchyards of Wales is the
Yew, and the Welsh people from time immemorial, have always regarded
the tree with solemn veneration, probably owing to its association with
the dead. The Yew is famed in Welsh song, for the poets of Cambria in
their elegies for their dead friends, often mention &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">Ywen Werdd y Llan</span>&rdquo; (the Green Yew of the Churchyard),
and the poet Ioan Emlyn in his &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Bedd y Dyn
Tlawd</span>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Pauper&rsquo;s Grave&rdquo;
says:</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Is yr Ywen ddu gangenog,</p>
<p class="line">Twmpath gwyrddlas gwyd ei ben.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In former times the yew was consecrated and held
sacred, and in funeral processions its branches were carried over the
dead by mourners, and thrown under the coffin in the grave. With
rosemary, ivy, bay, etc., branches of the trees were also used for
church decorations. The following extract from the Laws of Howel Dda,
King of Wales in the tenth century, shows that the yew tree was the
most valuable of all trees, and also how the consecrated yew of the
priests had risen in value over the reputed sacred mistletoe of the
Druids:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A consecrated yew, its value is a pound.</p>
<p class="line">A mistletoe branch, three score pence.</p>
<p class="line">An oak, six score pence.</p>
<p class="line">Principal branch of an oak, thirty pence.</p>
<p class="line">A yew-tree (not consecrated), fifteen pence.</p>
<p class="line">A sweet apple, three score pence.</p>
<p class="line">A sour apple, thirty pence.</p>
<p class="line">A thorn-tree, sevenpence half-penny.</p>
<p class="line">Every tree after that, four pence.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The planting of yew trees in Churchyards in Wales is as
old as the Churchyards themselves; and it is probable that they were
originally intended to act as a screen to the Churches by their thick
foliage, from the violence of the winds, as well as a shelter to the
congregation assembling before the church door was opened. The first
Churches in Wales were only wooden structures, and needed such screens
much more than the comfortable stone Churches of the present day.</p>
<p class="par">Another important object in planting the yew was to
furnish materials for bows, as these were the national weapons of
defence. The Churchyards were the places where they were most likely to
be preserved, and some authorities derive the English word
&ldquo;yeoman&rdquo; from yewmen, that is, the men who used the yew
bow. The yew bow was very common throughout Wales in the old times, and
skill in archery was universal in the country; and as late as Tudor
times, the Welsh poet, Tudur Aled, asks, in lamenting the death of a
squire:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Who can repeat his exploits to-day?</p>
<p class="line">Who knows so well the strength of yew.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In the memorable Battle of Cressy, three thousand
five hundred Welsh archers followed the Black Prince in the attack on
France in the year 1346, and as many more came from the Welsh
lordships, and bore such distinguished parts, for the success of this
war was due to the skill of the Welsh Archers, and at the end of the
battle the Prince adopted the motto, &ldquo;Ich Dien,&rdquo; which has
been the motto of the Princes of Wales ever since.</p>
<p class="par">Evelyn&rsquo;s opinion is &ldquo;that we find it (the
yew) so numerously planted in Churchyards from its being thought a
symbol of immortality, the tree being so lasting and always
green.&rdquo; There are at the present day in the Churchyards of
Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, some fine specimens of the yew tree,
and some of them hundreds of years, if not nearly a thousand years old.
In former times when Churchyards were resorted to for recreation, seats
were fixed round the trunk of the tree.</p>
<p class="par">Many of the Churchyards in Wales in ancient times,
before the introduction of Christianity, had been Druidical circles.
This is evident from the oval form of the ground of many of them, which
often resemble small embankments, or mounds. Such is the case as
regards Tregaron Church, in Cardiganshire, Llanddewi Brefi also is on
elevated ground, as well as several other Churchyards.</p>
<p class="par">How early the practice of enclosures near the Churches
or Monasteries for burial of the dead began in Wales is quite
uncertain. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>It seems that the practice was introduced into
England by Archbishop Cuthbert about 750; but the origin of Churchyards
in Wales was of a much earlier date, in all probability about two or
three hundred years earlier than in England. Some of the best
authorities assert that a few (but few only) of the Welsh Parish
Churches and consecrated Churchyards can be traced to the days of St.
Garmon, or Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, who paid two visits to this
country about A.D. 429, and 447 respectively. It is possible that there
were few Christians in Britain even in the first century; but Parochial
Churches did not belong to the earlier ages of Christianity, and the
clergy lived in towns, and undertook missionary journeys about the
country, under the direction of their bishops.</p>
<p class="par">Prior to the introduction of enclosures round Churches
for the purpose of burial, it was customary (as it is in China to-day),
to bury on high places, such as hills and mountains. Cremation had also
been practised as it is evident from the urns for the preservation of
the ashes of the dead, which are being discovered in various parts of
Wales, from time to time. Perhaps the most recent and interesting
discoveries of such urns were those found near Capel Cynon, in
Cardiganshire, containing ashes and portions of small calcined bones. A
labourer named John Davies, came across them accidentally in an old
mound on a hill, whilst working for Evan Thomas, a contractor under the
County Council of Cardiganshire, in digging out stones for
road-mending. (See Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis for January, 1905.)</p>
<p class="par">The introduction of Christianity put an end to the
practice of cremation.</p>
<p class="par">Carneddau, or cairns, and tumuli, or mounds of earth,
have been preserved till the present day in different parts of Wales,
but it is to be regretted that many of these interesting monuments of
antiquity, which the Welsh in ancient times erected in honour of their
great men have been destroyed. That Wales has been celebrated for its
Carneddau, is evident from the words of Taliesin, the chief poet of
King Arthur&rsquo;s time, who calls the country &ldquo;Cymru
Garneddog&rdquo; (Cairn Wales), and one the most interesting
&ldquo;Carnedd&rdquo; is what is known as &ldquo;<span lang="cy">bedd
Taliesin</span>&rdquo;&mdash;Taliesin&rsquo;s grave, about eight miles
north of Aberystwyth, where, according to tradition, Taliesin himself
was buried.</p>
<p class="par">Such monumental heaps over the mortal remains of the
dead were of two kinds, according to the nature of the country. In
stony districts, a cairn of stones was heaped, but where stones were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>scarce, a mound of turf of a circular
construction, called tomen (tumulus), was deemed sufficient.</p>
<p class="par">In ancient times this mode of burial was considered a
most honourable one, and in passing the tomb of a warrior or some great
man, it was customary for every passer by to throw a stone to the
cairn, out of reverence to his memory. There was a similar custom among
the Indians of Patagonia, which was still observed a few years ago. A
Patagonian Chief in passing the grave of an eminent chief or a great
warrior, would dismount from his horse, and search for a stone to throw
on the cairn.</p>
<p class="par">Monumental Cairns were also common in Scotland, for in
Ossian&rsquo;s Poems, Shibric, in Carricthura says: &ldquo;If fall I
must in the field, raise high my grave, Vinvela. Grey stones, and
heaped earth, shall mark me to future times.&rdquo; To erect mounds
seems to have been a very ancient custom, for Herodotus, in giving a
full and most interesting account of the strange practices of the
Ancient Scythians, in connection with the burial of their Kings,
observes amongst other things, &ldquo;Having done this, they all heap
up a large mound, striving and vieing with each other to make it as
large as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the custom of burying in churchyards became general
in Wales, in course of time, to bury in cairns and mounds, which
formerly had been an honourable practice, was discontinued, and even
condemned, as fit only for the great criminals; and, as Dr. Owen Pugh,
observes: &ldquo;when this heap became to be disgraced, by being the
mark where the guilty was laid, the custom for every one that passed,
to fling his stone, still continued, but now as a token of <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e1939" title=
"Source: destestation">detestation</span>&rdquo;; hence originated the
old Welsh sayings &ldquo;Carn lleidr (a thief&rsquo;s Cairn),
&ldquo;Carn ar dy wyneb.&rdquo; (Cairn on thy face). Even at the
present day throughout Wales, when any one is guilty of robbery or
swindle, it is customary to call such a man a &ldquo;Carn leidr&rdquo;
(A cairn thief). In the parish of Llanwenog, six miles from Lampeter,
there is a spot called &ldquo;Carn Philip Wyddyl.&rdquo; an old farmer,
named &ldquo;Tomos, Ty-cam,&rdquo; informed me that according to the
traditions of the district, this Philip was a &ldquo;Carn leidr,&rdquo;
or the ringleader of a gang of thieves, who, in an attempt to escape,
jumped down from Llanwenog Steeple, and broke his leg. His pursuers
stoned him to death, and buried him beneath a carn. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par xd24e1951"><span class="xd24e1951init">C</span>hristmas
at the present day in Wales is not so important as it used to be in
former times, though it is still the beginning of a holiday season, and
also a regular feasting-day. Morning service is conducted in the Parish
Church, but is not so well-attended as in former times. It is often the
custom to have an Eisteddfod or a concert in the evening in
Nonconformist Chapels. In towns, the children hang up their stockings
the night before Christmas, expecting to find some gifts in them next
morning. Christmas is also an important day for the young maidens to
kiss and be kissed. A girl places a mistletoe to hang over the chair in
which a young man, whom she wishes to catch, is likely to sit. Then
when he comes under the mistletoe, she kisses him suddenly, and
whenever she succeeds in doing so, she claims from him a new pair of
gloves.</p>
<p class="par">The favourite observance for a young man to kiss a girl
under the branches is also well known, and it was once supposed that
the maiden who missed being kissed under the mistletoe on Christmas
would forfeit her chance of matrimony, at least during the ensuing
twelve months. These superstitions and favourite observances have come
down from the time of the Druids.</p>
<p class="par">The most interesting feature of Christmas in Wales in
times gone by was undoubtedly the &ldquo;Plygain&rdquo; which means
morning twilight. The &ldquo;Plygain&rdquo; was a religious service
held in the Parish Church, at three o&rsquo;clock on Christmas morning
to watch the dawn commemorative of the coming of Christ, and the
daybreak of Christianity. The service consisted of song, prayer,
praise, and thanksgiving, and there was at that early hour a large
congregation even in remote districts, as many came from long
distances, often three or four miles on a frosty night, or through
snow. It was customary for each family to take their own candles with
them to this early service. These candles were of various colours, and
should any remain after the service was over, they became the property
of the clerk. Carols were sung, and it was customary for anyone who
claimed to be a bard to compose a carol; indeed, a poet was not
considered a poet unless he could sing a carol. Some old people
informed me that in connection with these early services there was a
great deal of disorder on account of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>men under the influence
of drink attending the Church after a night of revelry, and that this
put an end to the &ldquo;Plygain&rdquo; in some places. In course of
time the hour was changed from three to four or five, and such service
is still continued in Llanddewi Brefi and other places in
Cardiganshire.</p>
<p class="par">After beginning Christmas morning so devoutly with
Divine Service at early dawn, it was the custom in old times to spend
most of the day in enjoyment, especially hunting the hare, the
woodcock, but the chief sport was in connection with the squirrel.</p>
<p class="par">There was a custom once at Tenby, in Pembrokeshire, for
the young men of the town to escort the Rector, with lighted torches
from his residence to the Church to the early service on Christmas
morning. They extinguished their torches as soon as they reached the
porch, and went in to the early service in the Church, and at the
conclusion of it, the torches were re-lighted, and the procession
returned to the Rectory, the chimes ringing till the time of the usual
morning service. Lighted torches were also carried through the streets
by a procession on Christmas Eve, and cow-horns were blown, and windows
of houses were decorated by evergreens.</p>
<p class="par">In North Pembrokeshire the holidays commenced,
especially amongst the farmers, on Christmas Day, and were continued
for three weeks, viz., till Epiphany Sunday. The Rev. O. Jenkin Evans,
writing in &ldquo;Pembrokeshire Antiquities,&rdquo; page 47,
says:&mdash;&ldquo;On the 25th day of December, the farmers with their
servants and labourers suspended all farming operations, and in every
farm the plough was at once carried into the private house, and
deposited under the table in the &lsquo;Room Vord&rsquo; (i.e., the
room in which they took their meals), where it remained until the
expiration of &ldquo;Gwyliau Calan.&rdquo; During these three weeks,
parties of men went about from house to house, and were invited into
the &ldquo;Room Vord,&rdquo; where they sat around the table, regaling
themselves with beer, which was always kept warm in small neat brass
pans in every farm-house ready for callers. But the peculiar custom
which existed amongst these holiday-makers was that they always wetted
the plough which lay dormant under the table with their beer before
partaking of it themselves, thus indicating that though they had
dispensed with its service for the time, they had not forgotten it, and
it would again, in due course, be brought out on the green sward and
turn it topsy-turvy. These bands of men would sometimes carry with them
the &ldquo;Wren,&rdquo; singing simple popular ditties. On Christmas
Day, a sumptuous dinner was prepared at the principal farms in every
neighbourhood to which all the others, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>including the cottagers,
were invited. The repast consisted of geese, beef, pudding,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">One of the most curious customs which was once in vogue
about Christmas time was the procession known as &ldquo;Mari Lwyd
Lawen&rdquo; (&ldquo;the Merry Grey Mary&rdquo;), which was a man
wearing the skeleton of a horse&rsquo;s head decked with ribbons and
rosettes.</p>
<p class="par">The man was enveloped in a large white sheet, and
proceeded round the houses, followed by a merry procession, singing
songs and playing merry pranks, collecting Christmas boxes:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mari Lwyd lawen,</p>
<p class="line">Sy&rsquo;n dod o Bendarren,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(Merry grey Mary,</p>
<p class="line">Who comes from Pendarren.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">When a real skeleton could not be got, it was
customary to make one of straw and rags. It seems that &ldquo;Mari
Lwyd&rdquo; belonged more especially to Glamorganshire, yet it was
well-known in Carmarthenshire also, not only in those places bordering
on Glamorgan, but also in the Vales of Towy and Cothy. Mr. T. Davies
(Eryr Glyn Cothi), and others, informed me that the &ldquo;Mari&rdquo;
procession visited Llanegwad, and other places between Llandilo and
Carmarthen only a few years ago. The curious custom was not known in
Pembrokeshire, nor indeed in Cardiganshire, though I was informed that
&ldquo;Mari Lwyd&rdquo; on one occasion at least did visit the latter
county from Glamorganshire, and tramped across from Llandyssul, in the
Vale of Teify, to New Quay, on the sea coast, calling at Lampeter and
other places on the way.</p>
<p class="par">According to the excellent Magazine, named &ldquo;The
Cambrian Journal&rdquo; published 50 years ago, there was an old custom
once at Tenby in Pembrokeshire, sometimes before, and sometimes after
Christmas Day, for the fishermen to dress up one of their number, whom
they called the &ldquo;Lord Mayor of Penniless Cove,&rdquo; with a
covering of evergreens, and a mask over his face; they would then carry
him about, seated on a chair, with flags flying, and a couple of
violins playing before him.</p>
<p class="par">Before every house, the &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rdquo; would
address the occupants, wishing them &ldquo;a Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year.&rdquo; If his good wishes were responded to with money,
his followers gave three cheers, the masquer would himself return
thanks, and the crowd again give &ldquo;three times three,&rdquo; hip,
hip, hurrah!</p>
<p class="par">There was also in vogue once the barbarous practice of
&ldquo;holly beating.&rdquo; This was on the day after Christmas, St.
Stephen&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>Day, which consisted in a furious onslaught being
made by men and boys, armed with large bushes of the prickly holly, on
the naked and unprotected arms of female domestics, and others of a
like class.</p>

<h3 class="main">NEW YEAR&rsquo;S DAY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In Pembrokeshire, to rise early on New
Year&rsquo;s morning will, it is considered, bring good luck. On that
morning also it is deemed wise to bring a fresh loaf into the house as
it is considered the succeeding loaves throughout the year will be
influenced by that performance.</p>
<p class="par">In most places throughout West Wales, even at the
present day, people are very particular as to whether they see a man or
a woman the first thing on New Year&rsquo;s morning. Mr. Williams in
his <span class="corr" id="xd24e2000" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span><span lang="cy">Llen-gwerin Sir
Gaerfyrddin</span>,&rdquo; says that in parts of Carmarthenshire in
order to secure future luck or success during the coming year, a man
must see a woman, and a woman a man. And the Rev. N. Thomas, Vicar of
Llanbadarn Fawr, informed me that he has met people in his Parish who
consider it lucky to see a woman first. As a rule, however, the
majority of people both men and women deem it lucky to see a man, but
unlucky to see a woman.</p>
<p class="par">Even now in various parts of the country, good many
object to the entrance of a woman before the in-coming of one of the
other sex, this is particularly the case in the central parts of
Cardiganshire, especially in the Parish of Llanddewi Brefi and
surrounding districts between Lampeter and Tregaron. This is also true
of some parts of Pembrokeshire.</p>
<p class="par">According to the late Rector of Newport, Pembrokeshire,
the man must needs bear one of the four lucky names&mdash;Dafydd, Ifan,
Sion and Siencyn. &ldquo;Supposing the man was not called by one of
these names, the person first seen might as well be a woman, if she
only bore one of the lucky names&mdash;Sian a Sioned, Mair a Marged.
Then all would go well for that year at least. A hare or a magpie must
not cross one before twelve, and the cock must not crow before supper
on New Year&rsquo;s Day, or some dire calamity might befall one after
all.<span class="corr" id="xd24e2009" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="par">There was everywhere a general desire to see &ldquo;the
Old Year out and the New Year in.&rdquo; In South Pembrokeshire some
danced the old year out; some drank it out, and many walked it out. I
was informed at Talybont, that once those who desired to see &ldquo;the
New Year in &ldquo;crowded to each other&rsquo;s houses in North
Cardiganshire to pass the time in story-telling and feasting. The
children <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>especially, looked forward to New Year&rsquo;s
morning, with the greatest interest, as it was, and still is in some
places, customary for them to go about from house to house, asking for
&ldquo;calenig,&rdquo; or New Year&rsquo;s gift. The children on such
occasions often repeated something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="par first">The following is from an old song for New
Year&rsquo;s Day, heard at Tregaron in Cardiganshire:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Rhowch i mi docyn diogel,</p>

South Pembrokeshire, such verses as the following were
repeated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Get up on New Year&rsquo;s morning,</p>
<p class="line">The cocks are all a-crowing;</p>

<p class="par">When boys and girls knocked at the doors of misers who
refused to give anything, they went away disappointed, repeating</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Blwyddyn newydd ddrwg,</p>
<p class="line">A llond y ty o fwg.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A bad New Year to you,</p>
<p class="line">And a house full of smoke.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">But as a rule the farmers were very kind to all
comers, both in Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, and Pembrokeshire,
unless they had been disappointed by seeing a girl first that morning,
which was, as I have already observed, considered an unlucky omen. Even
at the present day this superstition is very strong in Llanddewi Brefi,
Cardiganshire, and, indeed, many other parts of Wales, for I have taken
particular notice that the first boy who comes to the door on New
Year&rsquo;s morning, if he happens to come before a girl is seen, he
is warmly welcomed into the house and even taken upstairs and into the
bedrooms so that those who are in their beds might have the
satisfaction of seeing a male the first thing on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
to secure good-luck. Before the boy departs some money is given him,
about sixpence as a rule at the present day, but in former times he got
a loaf of bread instead. At the present day boys and girls, and
occasionally a few poor old women continue to go round from house to
house from early dawn till mid-day collecting alms, when each of the
children receive a copper, in former times, however, it was more
customary to give them some bread and cheese, which they took home to
their parents in a bag which they carried on their backs, or a basket
under their arms.</p>
<p class="par">When the children had more than they could carry, they
would leave some of it at a certain house and return for it the
following day. In some places it was customary to keep on to collect
alms in this manner for two days, but only those who were in very poor
circumstances were allowed to go about on the second day.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary to carry an orange, with oats
stuck in it, placed on a stick, round the houses. The visitors sang at
the door and expected something to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="par">Another interesting custom observed, especially in
Pembrokeshire, on New Year&rsquo;s Day was for children to visit the
houses in the morning about 3 or 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning with a
vessel filled with spring water, fresh from the well and with the aid
of a sprig of evergreen, sprinkled the faces of those they met, and at
the same time singing as follows:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Here we bring new water from the well so
clear,</p>
<p class="line">For to worship God with, this Happy New Year;</p>
<p class="line">Sing levy dew, sing levy dew, the water and the
wine,</p>
<p class="line">With seven bright gold wires, and bugles that do
shine;</p>
<p class="line">Sing reign of fair maid, with gold upon her toe,</p>
<p class="line">Open you the west door and turn the old year go;</p>
<p class="line">Sing reign of fair maid, with gold upon her chin,</p>
<p class="line">Open you the east door and let the New Year
in.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">When the children entered into a house, it was
customary for them to sprinkle every one of the family even in their
beds with this fresh spring water, and they received a small fee for
the performance.</p>
<p class="par">There was a ceremony among the Druids and others in
ancient times, of throwing spring water over the shoulder in order to
command the attention of elemental spirits.</p>
<p class="par">It is customary in some places, especially in parts of
Carmarthenshire, for young men to sprinkle the young girls with water
in their beds, and the young maidens in their turn sprinkle the young
men, and this is sometimes done when the one upon whom water is thrown
is fast asleep.</p>
<p class="par">It is still customary for young men with musical
instruments to visit the palaces of the gentry at early dawn, and play
some of the beautiful old Welsh Airs, when they receive warm welcome
and generous gifts.</p>
<p class="par">Among Twelfth Night Custom, none was more celebrated in
Pembrokeshire in the eighteenth century and the beginning of the
nineteenth than the &ldquo;cutty wren,&rdquo; though there are hardly
any traces of the custom in Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire. The
custom was something as follows:</p>
<p class="par">Having procured a wren, the bird was placed in a little
house of paper with glass windows, sometimes a cage or a lantern, or a
box was used for that purpose, and often decorated with coloured
ribbons, and &ldquo;every young lady, and even old ladies, used to
compete in presenting the grandest ribbon to the
&ldquo;wren.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The cage or the lantern thus decorated with the little
bird in it, was hoisted on four poles, one at each corner, and four men
carried it about for the purpose of levying contributions, singing a
long ballad or ditty such as follows on the following tune:&mdash;

&ldquo;Manners and Customs of the People of Tenby&rdquo; in &ldquo;The
Cambrian Journal,&rdquo; Vol. IV., page 177.</p>
<p class="par">I may add that I heard the above ditty sung in Welsh in
several parts of South Wales, especially when I was a boy.</p>
<p class="par">Another such custom was called &ldquo;tooling,&rdquo;
and its purpose was beer. It consisted in calling at the farm-houses
and pretending to look for one&rsquo;s tools behind the beer cask.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left my saw behind your beer cask,&rdquo; a carpenter
would say; &ldquo;my whip,&rdquo; a carter; and received the tool by
proxy, in the shape of a cup of ale. It was also customary for the
women to practice what was called sowling, viz., asking for
&ldquo;sowl,&rdquo; that is cheese, fish or meat.</p>
<p class="par">It was also customary in parts of the counties of
Pembroke and Carmarthen for poor people to proceed round the
neighbourhood from house to house with their &ldquo;Wassail
bowls,&rdquo; and singing outside each door something as
follows&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Taste our jolly wassail bowl,</p>
<p class="line">Made of cake, apple, ale, and spice;</p>
<p class="line">Good master give command,</p>
<p class="line">You shall taste once or twice</p>
<p class="line">Of our jolly wassail bowl.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">People who partook of the contents of the bowl
were of course expected to pay, so that the invitation to &ldquo;taste
our jolly wassail <span class="corr" id="xd24e2298" title=
"Source: boul">bowl</span>,&rdquo; was not always accepted. In such
cases the bearer of the bowl sung the following rhyme in
disappointment:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Are there any maidens here,</p>
<p class="line">As I suppose there&rsquo;s none</p>
<p class="line">Or they wouldn&rsquo;t leave us here,</p>
<p class="line">With our jolly wassail bowl.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The huge bowl was on the table, brimful of
ale. William held a saucepan, into which Pally and Rachel poured the
ale, and which he subsequently placed upon the fire. Leaving it to
boil, the party seated round the fire began to roast some of the apples
that Pally had just put upon the table. This they effected by tying
long pieces of twine to their stems, and suspending them from the
different &ldquo;pot-hooks and hangers&rdquo; with which the chimney
corner abounded, twisting the cord from time to time to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>prevent
their burning.... By the time they had all completed their trials the
ale was boiling and the apples were roasted. The tempting beverage went
smoking hot into the bowl, and was joined by the contents of a small,
suspicious-looking, tightly-corked bottle, which I strongly suspect,
contained what the French call the &ldquo;water of life,&rdquo; and a
very strong water it undoubtedly is. Next there was a hissing and
splutting greeting between the ale and the roasted apples, which was
succeeded by the introduction of some of the &ldquo;nices,&rdquo; with
which Pally&rsquo;s table was covered. Different masculines of the
party added to the treat by producing packets of buns, raisins, or
biscuits, which they dropped singly into the bowl until it was full to
overflowing. With a sufficient proportion of spices and sugar, the
wassail bowl was finally prepared, and, as if by instinct, just as it
was completed, in popped three or four of Pally&rsquo;s ancient
cronies, all dying to partake of it. The cups and glasses were speedily
filled, when William proposed Pally&rsquo;s health, which was cordially
drunk by the whole party.&rdquo; (The Vale of Towey, pages
83&ndash;87).</p>
<p class="par">It was customary also, especially in parts of
Carmarthenshire, on &ldquo;Calan Hen&rdquo; (Old New Year&rsquo;s Day)
to make a feast for those who had helped them with the harvest.</p>
<p class="par">It was also once customary on Epiphany Night in West
Wales to visit the houses of those who had been married since the
Epiphany before. Those who went round the houses in this manner
requested admittance in rhyme and expected food and beer to be given to
them by the inmates. Epiphany, known in Wales as &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">Gwyl Ystwyll</span>,&rdquo; was formerly closely associated with
Christmas.</p>
<p class="par">Many of the old customs and festivities in connection
with the New Year are of great antiquity; it was then that the Druids
went to seek the mistletoe on the oak. To the Druids the oak and the
mistletoe were objects of veneration; and one of the most imposing
ceremonies was the cutting of the latter, some days before the New
Year, with a Golden Knife, in a forest dedicated to the gods; and the
distributing its branches with much ceremony as New Year&rsquo;s Gifts
among the people.</p>
<p class="par">On the day for cutting the mistletoe, a procession of
Bards, Druids, and Druidesses was formed to the forest, and singing all
the while. The Arch-Druid climbed the tree and cut down the mistletoe,
the other Druids spreading a sheet to receive it.</p>
<p class="par">This scene was enacted with great success at the Builth
Wells Pageant, August, 1909&mdash;(see illustration)&mdash;which I
witnessed myself with interest. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69"
href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Romans had also their festival in honour of Janus
and Strenia about the same time of the year. It is interesting to add
that in England in the days of King Alfred a law respecting Feast Days
was passed, in which the twelve days after the birth of Christ were
made a season of holidays.</p>

<p class="par first">The custom of sending a pretty Valentine, or an

very common once in Wales. We do not hear much of Valentines at the

<h3 class="main">ST. DAVID&rsquo;S DAY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">St. David is the Patron Saint of Wales, and
strange to say the only Welsh Saint in the Calendar of the Western
Church (Canonized by Calixtus II.) more than five hundred years after
his death.</p>
<p class="par">His day is celebrated on the 1st of March throughout the
world where Welshmen are. In Wales there are in some places grand
dinners, and speeches are made and songs sung, and at present it is
customary to conduct Divine Service on the day even in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, London. But perhaps the most characteristic feature of the
day is the wearing of the Leek, though it must be admitted that wearing
the Leek on St. David&rsquo;s Day is not very general in the country
districts of Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire at the present day, but
the interesting old custom is reviving, especially in the towns, and
every true-born Welshman ought to wear on the 1st of March the Welsh
National Emblem which is dedicated to St. David.</p>
<p class="par">The origin of the custom is not known, there are many
who positively assert that it originated in the days of St. David
himself; that is, according to some traditions, during a memorable
battle against the Saxons the Welsh obtained a complete victory over
their enemies. During the engagement the Welsh had leeks in their hats
on the occasion for their military colour and distinction of
themselves, by persuasion of the said prelate St. David.</p>
<p class="par">According to other traditions, the battle of Poictiers
has been named; also that of Cressy, when the Welsh archers did good
service with the English against the French, under Edward the Black
Prince of Wales, and Shakespeare alludes to this in Henry
V.:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Fluellen says to Henry: &ldquo;If your Majesty is
remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks
did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps; which your Majesty
knows, to this hour is an honourable <span class="corr" id="xd24e2357"
title="Source: padge">badge</span> of the service; and, I do believe,
your Majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek on St. Tavy&rsquo;s
Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">King Henry: &ldquo;I wear it for a memorable honour; for
I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It seems that there was a custom in London 250 years ago
of hanging effigies of Welshmen on St. David&rsquo;s Day; for Pepys
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">(March 1, 1667). In Mark Lane I do observe (it being St.
David&rsquo;s Day), the picture of a man dressed like a Welshman,
hanging by the neck upon one of the poles that stand out at the top of
one of the merchants&rsquo; houses, in full proportion and very
handsomely done, which is one of the oddest sights I have seen a good
while.</p>

<p class="par">Mr. Williams in his excellent Welsh essay on the Folk
Lore of Carmarthenshire, says that he had been informed by a middle
aged person of a curious old custom of playing with eggs. Mr.
<span class="corr" id="xd24e2406" title=
"Source: Wiliams&rsquo;s">Williams&rsquo;s</span> informant when a
child and other children with him, had been taught by an old woman how
to play some peculiar game with eggs on this day, which was something
as follows:&mdash;Eggs were boiled for two or three hours till they
were as hard as stones. The children used to colour their eggs for the
prettiest by boiling them in coffee with certain herbs, etc., then for
half of the day, they kept throwing the eggs at each other. This
curious kind of play reminds me of a similar practice which I noticed
in South America many years ago, more especially in the Argentine
Republic, where it was customary for the first half of the day for
people to throw eggs, water, etc., at each other, and this was done
even in the sheets of Buenos Ayres. The custom was known as &ldquo;El
Carnival,&rdquo; that is giving way to the flesh before the beginning
of Lent or Fasting Time.</p>
<p class="par">In the North of England boys play with eggs on Easter
Eve, and centuries ago eggs were blest by the Priest and preserved as
Amulates.</p>
<p class="par">It was once customary for the tenants of Nanteos, in
North Cardiganshire, to give to their landlord Shrove Hens and Eggs

survival of the old custom of paying rent, or a portion of it,

<h3 class="main">GOOD FRIDAY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Good Friday in Welsh is called &ldquo;Dydd Gwener
Groglith (The Lesson of the Cross Friday).</p>
<p class="par">Not much notice is taken at present day of the day, and
the services conducted in the Parish Churches in country places are as
a rule poorly attended. In former times there were many interesting
customs and strange superstitions in connection with the day,
especially in the South of Pembrokeshire, where there was once a custom
called &ldquo;Making Christ&rsquo;s Bed,&rdquo; which was done by
gathering a quantity of long reeds from the river and woven into the
shape of a man. Then this was stretched on a wooden cross, and laid in
a field.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that it was customary in that particular part
of West Wales, especially at Tenby, to walk barefooted to Church, and
that such Pre-Reformation custom continued till the close of the
eighteenth century, which was done so as not to disturb the earth! In
returning from Church the people regaled themselves with hot cross
buns, and after reaching the house they were eaten. But a certain
number of them were tied up in a bag, and hung in the kitchen, where
they remained till the next Good Friday, for medical purposes, for it
was believed that the eating of one of them cured diseases. They were
also used as a panacea for the diseases of animals, as well as
serviceable to frighten away evil spirits and goblins. These hot cross
buns which figured in such a peculiar manner in South Pembrokeshire,
nothing is known of them in the adjoining counties of Carmarthen and
Cardigan, among the country people; it is possible, however, that they
were known there prior to the Reformation or even after. But perhaps
the bun custom was unknown in those two counties, and it had been
introduced into South Pembrokeshire (where the people are not of Welsh
origin), from England or some other country. Some writers trace the
origin of hot cross buns to the cakes which the pagan Saxons used to
eat in honour of their goddess Eostre, and that the custom dates back
to pre-historic times, and that their connection with the Cross of our
Saviour is only by adoption. How far this is true it is impossible to
know with certainty; but it is evident that the early Christians
adopted many pagan rites and customs. According to Hone&rsquo;s Year
Book, the hot cross buns are the ecclesiastic Eulogiae or Consecrated
Loaves bestowed in the Church as alms, and to those who could not
receive the Host. It was once the custom in Wales to express abhorrence
of Judas Iscariot, and the curious custom of flogging him is still in
vogue <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>in South America. In former times Good Friday was
the day on which rings were blessed by Kings and given away as remedies
for the cramp.</p>

<h3 class="main">EASTER.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is deemed essential by many people to wear some
new article of dress, if only a pair of gloves or a new ribbon; for not
to do so is considered unlucky, and the birds will be angry with you.
It is probable that the origin of this custom is associated with Easter
baptism, when a new life was assumed by the baptised, clothed in
righteousness as a garment. In former times people had such respect for
this day that many kept their children unbaptised till Easter Sunday,
and many old men and old women went to Church to receive the Communion
who were hardly to be seen in the Lord&rsquo;s House on any other
Sunday during the year.</p>
<p class="par">There was once an old fancy in Wales that the sun used
to dance for joy when it rose on Easter morning, and great care was
taken in some places to get up the children and young people to see
such sight of the sun dancing in honour of the rising of our Lord. The
sun was sometimes aided in this performance by a bowl of clear water,
into which the youth must look and see the orb dance, as it would be
dangerous to look directly on the sun while thus engaged. The religious
dance of the ancient Druids is believed to exist in modern times in a
round dance wherein the figures imitate the motions of the sun and
moon. See &ldquo;British Goblins,&rdquo; by Sykes, page 274.</p>

May-day dances and revelling were most popular, especially in
Pembrokeshire, as the following interesting account which appeared in
the &ldquo;Cambrian Journal&rdquo; proves:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On May-eve, the inhabitants would turn out in
troops, bearing in their hands boughs of thorn in full blossom, which
were bedecked with other flowers, and then stuck outside the windows of
the houses. Maypoles were reared up in different parts of the town (of
Tenby), decorated with flowers, coloured papers, and bunches of
variegated ribbon. On May-day the young men and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>maidens
would, joining hand in hand, dance round the May-poles, and
&ldquo;thread the needle,&rdquo; as it was termed. A group of fifty to
a hundred persons would wend their ways from one pole to another, till
they had thus traversed the town. Meeting on their way other groups,
who were coming from an opposite direction, both parties would form a
&ldquo;lady&rsquo;s chain,&rdquo; and to pass on their respective
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The May-pole was once most popular in Wales, but the old
custom has entirely died out, though we still hear occasionally of a
May Queen being selected in some places.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The May-pole in Wales was called Bedwen, because
it was always made of birch which is called in Welsh Bedwen, a tree
associated with the gentler emotions; and as I have already observed in
another chapter, to give a lover a birchen branch, is for a maiden to
accept his addresses. Games of various sorts were played around the
bedwen. The fame of a village depended on its not being stolen away,
and parties were constantly on the alert to steal the bedwen, a feat
which, when accomplished, was celebrated with peculiar festivities.
This rivalry for the possession of the May-pole was probably typical of
the ancient idea that the first of May was the boundary day dividing
the confines of winter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"

the powers of the air, on the one hand striving to continue the reign
of winter on the other to establish that of summer.</p>

where it speaks of the daughter of Lludd Llaw Eraint. She was the most
splendid maiden in the three Islands of the mighty, and in three
islands adjacent, and for her does Gwyn Ap Nudd, the fairy King, fight
every first of May till the day of doom.</p>
<p class="par">She was to have been the bride of Gwythyr, the son of
Greidawl, when Gwyn Ap Nudd carried her off by force. The bereaved
bridegroom followed, and there was a bloody struggle, in which Gwyn was
victorious, and he acted most cruelly, for he slew an old warrior, took
out his heart from his breast, and constrained the warrior&rsquo;s son
to eat the heart of his father.</p>
<p class="par">When Arthur heard of this he summoned Gwyn Ap Nudd
before him, and deprived him of the fruits of his victory. But he
condemned the two combatants to fight for the maiden Olwen henceforth
for ever on every first of May till doomsday; the victor on that day to
possess the maiden.</p>
<p class="par">In former times a fire of logs was kindled on the first
day of May, around which it was customary for men and women, youths and
maidens, to dance hand in hand, singing to the harp, and some of the
men would leap over the fire, even at the peril of being burnt. The
origin of such strange custom is undoubtedly to be traced to the
&ldquo;belltaine&rdquo; fires of the Druids.</p>
<p class="par">It seems these bon-fires were lighted in some parts of
Wales on Midsummer Eve, and the &ldquo;Glain Nadrodd&rdquo;
(snake-stones) were also, according to Welsh traditions, associated
with the same time of the year.</p>
<p class="par">It is called Glain Nadrodd from the old Welsh tradition
that it is made by snakes at some special gathering among them, when
one of their number is made a kind of sacrifice out of the body of
which they manufacture the stone. It is of a greenish colour and of the
size of an ordinary marble. To find a &ldquo;Glain Nadrodd&rdquo; is
considered a very lucky omen and they were anciently used as charms. It
was also believed in former times that the bon-fires lighted in May or
Midsummer protected the lands from sorcery, so that good crops would
follow. The ashes were also considered valuable as charms.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Eve of All Saints is known in Wales as
&ldquo;Nos Calan Gaeaf,&rdquo; and in former times there were many old
customs in connection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>with it, most of which have now disappeared.
I have already given an account of the Love Charms and spells which
were performed on this eve, and amongst other strange doings, the
uncanny custom of going round the Church in order to see the spirit of
a future husband or wife. But there was in some places another weird
ceremony of going round the church at midnight, and look in through the
keyhole in order to see the spectral forms, or to hear a spirit calling
the names of all those who were to die in the neighbourhood during the
year; that is during the coming twelve months from that date, which
seems to suggest that the new year began at this time once in old
times. Many were afraid, especially children, of going out on
Allhallow&rsquo;s Eve as the night among the Welsh was one of the
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">tair nos ysprydion</span>&rdquo; (three
spirits&rsquo; nights) as it was supposed that the spirits were free to
roam about, and a demon at large in the form of a &ldquo;<span lang=

<p class="line">(On Allhallow&rsquo;s Eve,</p>
<p class="line">A bogie on every stile.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">On this eve it was formerly the custom to kindle a
bonfire, a practice which continued to a more recent date in the
Northern part of the Principality than in the South.</p>
<p class="par">Besides fuel, each person present used to throw into the
fire a small stone, with a mark whereby he should know it again. If he
succeeded in finding the stone on the morrow, the year would be a lucky
one for him, but the contrary if he failed to recover it.</p>
<p class="par">Those who assisted at the making of the bonfire watched
until the flames were out, and then somebody would raise the usual cry,
when each ran away for his life, lest he should be found last, and be
overtaken by the &lsquo;bogie.&rsquo;&mdash;(See &ldquo;Celtic
Folk-Lore,&rdquo; by Sir J. Rhys, page 225.)</p>
<p class="par">When a boy, I well remember young men and boys who were
full of mischief, making a hollow inside a turnip, and having put a
candle in it, carried it about as a bogie to frighten timid people.</p>
<p class="par">Allhallow&rsquo;s Eve is known in many parts of West
Wales as &ldquo;Nos twco fale,&rdquo; (apple snatching night), and the
game of snatching apples, has been continued in some districts until
only a few years ago. Apples and candles, fastened to strings, were
suspended from the ceiling and the merry-makers in trying to catch the
apple frequently got the candle instead, to the great amusement of
those present. Another amusing custom was to try to bring up an apple
with the teeth from a tub of water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In some parts of the country, especially
Carmarthenshire, it was customary to peel the apple carefully, and
throw it, that is the peel, back over the head. Then when this peel had
fallen on the floor behind one&rsquo;s back, particular notice was
taken in what form it appeared, and whenever it resembled a letter of
the Alphabet, the same was supposed to be the first letter of the
Christian name of the thrower&rsquo;s future wife or husband.</p>

<h3 class="main">HARVEST CUSTOMS, Etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Y Gaseg Fedi, or Harvest Mare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In West and Mid-Wales there have been various harvest
customs, the most interesting of which was probably the Harvest Mare,
known in Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire as &ldquo;Y Gaseg Fedi, or
Gaseg Ben-Fedi,&rdquo; but in Pembrokeshire it was called &ldquo;Y
Wrach.&rdquo; This took place at the end of the harvest.</p>
<p class="par">There was a large crowd of both men and women reaping on
the last day; and by working at the harvest in this manner small
cottagers and other poor people paid the farmer for the privilege of
planting a few rows of potatoes in the land, and for the loan of a
horse and cart, or for carting home coal, etc.. By working at the
harvest poor people paid their debt to the farmer, and still do so to a
certain extent. To each of the women who worked at the harvest was
given a candle to take home with her every evening, and to the men a
little tobacco was given to those who indulged in the bad habit of
smoking.</p>
<p class="par">An old woman 98 years of age, who lived near Crosswood,
Cardiganshire, informed me about three years ago that she well
recollected when a child that a farmer who lived at Penllwyn, in the
Vale of Rheidol, used to give to each of the men and women a sheaf to
take home with them in the evening, and that this farmer was the only
one in the country who did this within her memory, and that he did it
as he had seen his father doing so. The old lady also added that the
custom had been general once.</p>
<p class="par">It was the custom once to &ldquo;<span lang="cy">dwrn
fedi</span>&rdquo; (fist reaping) a very laborious work, for our
forefathers had no scythes nor machines in former times, so that the
sickle was everything. It was customary once for a number of farmers in
the same district to arrange together not to cut their fields on the
same day so that they might be able to assist each other. A few men
would come together on an appointed day from each farm in the district
that they might be able to cut and bind all the corn of one farm in a
single day; and it is still the custom in many places to do this in
connection with hay as well as shearing sheep on the mountains.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Gaseg Fedi (harvest mare) at the end of the harvest
was a small quantity of the last corn which was left standing in the
field, and tied up carefully; and great excitement existed, and much
amusement was created when the last standing was reached. There was a
good deal of fun in connection with cutting the mare. Each reaper in
his turn was allowed to throw his sickle at the corn until it was cut,
from a distance of about 15 or 20 yards. The most unskilful were
allowed to try first, at last some one would succeed in cutting it down
amidst cheers. After cutting it down, it was customary in some places,
especially in the North of Cardiganshire for one of the men to take the
mare to a neighbouring farm, where the harvest had not been completed,
and where the reapers would be still busy at work. The man who took the
mare in this manner was very careful to go, or crept without being
observed, and stealthily stationed himself over against the foreman of
his neighbour&rsquo;s reapers, he watched an opportunity, when within
easy distance of throwing it suddenly over the hedge into his
neighbour&rsquo;s field, and if possible upon the foreman&rsquo;s
sickle and at the same time repeating some insulting words and took to
his heels with all speed to escape the flying sickle of the reapers
whom he had insulted which were hurled after him, and sometimes he was
in peril of his life. In some districts in Carmarthenshire, it was
sometimes the practice to be as bold as to take the Gaseg even to the
very house of the neighbour, but this was considered more insulting if
anything than throwing it into his field.</p>
<p class="par">According to old people who remembered the custom in
their younger days, they informed me that it was not considered right
to throw the mare into the field of a farmer who lived in another
parish, or over a river or even a brook. I was also informed by some
that it was not allowable to bear it up hill to a field which stood on
a more elevated ground. It was often the custom especially in
Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, instead of throwing it into a
neighbour&rsquo;s field, to convey it home to the house, that is to the
house of the farmer himself who had finished his harvest that day. The
honour of bearing it home in this manner belonged to the one who had
succeeded in cutting it, but the difficult part of it was how to take
it into the house dry, for it was absolutely necessary that it should
be taken into the house without being wetted. And this was not always
an easy task as the servant maids at the house carefully stored water
in buckets and pans ready to throw over the man and his Caseg Fedi at
his entrance; and sometimes he would have a pretty rough time of
it<span class="corr" id="xd24e2552" title="Not in source">.</span> In
order to prevent this the man tried to appear as indifferent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>as possible so as not to be suspected by the
girls. Consequently, he carefully hid the mare under his clothes, but
in spite of everything he was sometimes stripped of some part of his
garment or deluged with water. But when he could succeed in bringing it
into the house dry and hung it up without being observed, the master
had to pay the bearer a shilling or two, or to give him plenty of beer.
But the master was spared to pay the shilling if the girls could
succeed in wetting the mare. These curious old customs have been
discontinued, but it is still the practice with some to bring a handful
of corn into the house tied up under the name of the mare. At supper
that evening there was a good deal of fun. John Wright, Bailiff of
Stackpole in Pembrokeshire, refers to the custom as follows when
writing to his master, Mr. Pryce Campbell, August,
1736:&mdash;&ldquo;Whilst I was abroad (he had been in Cardiganshire)
the harvest people cut the neck, and, notwithstanding all the stones
about the court (this house was being rebuilt), would have a dance. The
dance was the Three Shopkins. There was a noble feast, the bill of fare
was as follows:&mdash;Four quarters of mutton, a side of bacon, a piece
of beef weighing half a hundred-weight, twelve gallons of Buding
besides, cabotch and other greens. They seemed very well pleased with
their entertainment.&rdquo; It was customary in some places to have a
harvest queen attired in white gown decorated with ears of wheat and
roses. In other places a sheaf of wheat was decorated with ribbons and
taken home to the farm on the top of the last load, when the horses
were also very gaily decked.</p>
<p class="par">At the close of the harvest it was an universal custom
to have a harvest supper, and after the feast there was a merry time.
The Rev. D. G. Williams mentions &ldquo;Chware Dai Shon Goch&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rhibo&rdquo; as favourite games on such occasions.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Chware Dai Shon Goch&rdquo; was something as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Two young men, or two young women would put on some old
ragged clothes kept at the farm for that purpose, and thus attired
would proceed to the barn where a walking-stick was given to each of
the two. Then followed a most curious dance to the great amusement of
the company of beholders. At present, however, the Welshpeople in
country places know nothing of dancing; but it is evident that they
were much given to dancing in former times as well as singing to the
harp. Owen Tudor, the Welsh gentleman who became the grandfather of
Henry VII., King of England, was invited to dance some of the dances of
Wales before Katherine, the beautiful widow of Henry V. While the
handsome young <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>Welshman was dancing one of his wild reels, it
chanced that he fell against the Queen, and the latter with a
bewitching smile, said, &ldquo;that so far from offending her, it would
only increase the pleasure of herself and company, if he would repeat
the same false step or mistake!&rdquo; Later on, Katherine and Owen
Tudor were married.</p>
<p class="par">Another game on such occasions was &ldquo;Rhibo&rdquo;
which was something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Six young men were selected for the performance, three
standing face to face to the other three, and each one taking hold of
the hands of the one who faced him. Then upon the arms of these six
young men, a young man and a young woman were placed in a leaning
posture who were thrown up and allowed to fall again into the arms of
the young men, and this ceremony continued for some time, and which
appeared to be rather a rough game, but it is not practised at the
present day.</p>
<p class="par">In former times it was customary at some farms to blow
the horn at harvest time to call the reapers both to their work and
their meals. Such horn was made use of for that purpose until very
recently at a farm called Eurglodd, eight miles north of Aberystwyth in
Cardiganshire.</p>

<h3 class="main">CYNNOS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Cynnos&rdquo; was a practice among the
farmers of West Wales, and particularly Cardiganshire, of taking the
corn to the kiln to be dried on the night before the grinding; it was
customary to sit watching it all night and carefully attend to the
drying operations, that is the turning of the corn on the kiln, and the
sweeping of it off, when it had been sufficiently dried. The meaning of
the word &ldquo;Cynnos&rdquo; is unknown, according to some writers it
is a form of &ldquo;cynwys&rdquo; (contents)&mdash;that is the contents
of a stack of corn; but according to others it meant
&ldquo;cyn-nos&rdquo; (the night before) that is the night before the
grinding.</p>
<p class="par">It is true that the farmers sent small quantities of
corn to the mill at any time of the year; but the big annual
&ldquo;cynnos&rdquo; was prepared, as a rule, about January or
February. This &ldquo;Cynnos&rdquo; was a night of great fun,
especially for young people, as many of the friends and neighbours of
those who were engaged in drying the corn came together in the evening.
An old gentleman named Thomas Evans, Gwarallyryn in the parish of
Llandyssul, Cardiganshire, who well remembered the old custom, gave me
an interesting account of it. This meeting of young men and young women
and others at the kiln during the Cynnos to enjoy themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>with games and story telling was known, said he,
as &ldquo;Shimli,&rdquo; which often continued all night. Sometimes
beer known as &ldquo;Fetchin,&rdquo; was sent for, and drank around the
kiln fire. When the flour was taken home, it was put in chests.
Previous to the beginning of the 19th century before kilns attached to
the mills became general, many of the farm houses had a kiln for drying
the corn at home, but of a very primitive sort. Mr. Price in his
interesting little book on Llansawel, in Carmarthenshire, says that the
last kiln of the sort for drying the corn at home in that parish was in
use at a farm called Cilwenau isaf, worked as late as 1845. He also
adds that the shape and the build of this primitive contrivance was
something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">On a gentle-sloping ground a hollow, three yards long,
two yards wide, and two deep, was cut, and two planks placed at right
angles to each other, their ends resting on the surface outside the
hollow. These served to support the sticks which were placed regularly
over the kiln until covered. Over the whole clean straw was laid, upon
which the corn was placed to be dried. Underneath all this and at the
lower end of the kiln, the fire was placed, so that the heat and smoke
went under the straw contrivance above. About the month of May, it was
once customary in Pembrokeshire for farmers to bring their
&ldquo;Benwent,&rdquo; that is, two or three loads of grain to the mill
to be ground and milled, and young men and young women came together on
such occasions, and indulged in a sport known as &ldquo;Byng,&rdquo; or
dressing up a horse&rsquo;s head and carrying it about, not unlike
&ldquo;Mari Lwyd.&rdquo; The Rev. Jenkin Evans, Pontfaen, in the
&ldquo;Pembrokeshire Antiquities,&rdquo; also adds that it was
customary on May Day for women and children to go round the farmhouses
with their basins to receive butter, which enabled poor people to enjoy
butter on their bread for some weeks.</p>

<h3 class="main">SHEEP SHEARING CUSTOMS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following extract which I translate from an
introduction to a volume of Welsh Poems known as &ldquo;Cerddi
Cerngoch,&rdquo; gives an interesting account of Sheep Shearing customs
in West Wales fifty years ago:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A great day at Blaenplwyf was the sheep shearing
day, The sheep were kept for the summer at Bronbyrfe, Llanddewi Brefi,
with John Jenkins. During Ffair Beder (Peter&rsquo;s Fair) July 10th
every year there was a &ldquo;<span lang="cy">cnaif</span>&rdquo;
(shearing). Good many were anxious to get the &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">fei</span>.&rdquo; The service of about half-a-dozen neighbours
was secured to look after the shearing. David Davies, Rhiwonen; John
Davies, Pantfedwen; Thomas Davies, Pencoed; Daniel Davies, Gelligwenin,
had been doing it; and my father, and my uncles of Trecefel, Pant,
Penbryn and Clwtpatrwn, were faithful year after year. To swell the
company, others from time to time took a day&rsquo;s holiday and
enjoyment, and amongst many others, Mr. J. E. Rogers, Abermeurig; Rev.
Evan Evans, Hafod; Rev. John Davies, Llandeloy; Thos. Thomas (Norton
Brewery), Carmarthen; Ben. Jenkins, solicitor; Aeronian, etc.</p>
<p class="par">Llwyd, Llundain, told me: &ldquo;When my father failed
going to the shearing, my brother Shanco, or myself, was allowed to go,
and we longed to go, for it was the very thing for us.<a id="xd24e2615"
name="xd24e2615"></a> Little work and plenty of enjoyment, and you know
that not one of Shencyn Grufydd&rsquo;s family had any objection to a
thing of that kind.<a id="xd24e2617" name="xd24e2617"></a> A start was
made from Blaenplwyf at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning. At first it
was customary to proceed on horses through Llanfair and over the bog
and meadow to Bronbyrfe. One or two young women went to look after the
wool. It was brought home on horses. After that &lsquo;gist cart&rsquo;
and the &lsquo;long body&rsquo; came in use, and lastly the
&lsquo;gambo.&rsquo; When going over the mountain one time (1855), and
&lsquo;Cerngoch,&rsquo; to be sure, among the foremost of the mounted
band, Shencyn gave out the order to form into a rank as soldiers, and
after getting things into order, he said:&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>&ldquo;Here we are now like cavalry attacking the
Russians.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not quite so,&rdquo; said Cerngoch, &ldquo;if
we were in the Crimea, you my little brother, would not be so far in
advance of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Timothy and Benjamin were in School of Parkyvelvet,
under the celebrated old tutor, Rev. Titus Evans, in 1855, and both of
them and their second cousin, Mr. Thomas, Myrtle Villa, Wellfield Road,
Carmarthen (now) had come on their holidays, and forming a part of the
company. As Mr. Thomas was a townsman, he was not acquainted with the
horse and the land, so the horse went out of the path, and into the
bog, and Cerngoch sang at once:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Roedd mab o dre Caerfyrddin,</p>
<p class="line">Yn steilus iawn a&rsquo;i ferlin;</p>
<p class="line">Wrth dd&rsquo;od ar &lsquo;mynydd yn y mawn,</p>
<p class="line">Bu&rsquo;n isel iawn ei asyn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">.... After reaching Bronbyrfe, those who were
responsible went in for the shearing; but the others scattered along
the small brooks which were close by in order to fish; each one with
his favourite tackle, hands, fly, hook and bait, etc. Hywel was by far
the master. When all the others had failed with the fly and bait, Hywel
would have a basketful. He was so clever with the fly&mdash;the bait
according to the colour of the water.... After eating the black
nourishing fish, and ending the shearing, it was customary to go home
through Llanddewi. The young men of Llanddewi knew when the Blaenplwyf
shearing took place, and were watching them on their homeward journey
with great excitement. Then (at Llanddewi) a game of ball was played on
the corner of the old chapel, near the Foelallt Arms since then. Not an
air ball as at present, but a ball of yarn carefully wound up, and
covered with leather as tight as possible. Four were the required
number intended to take part in the game, two on each side.
&ldquo;After drinking the health of those who won, off goes the party,
each one for the first making for Bettws, about five miles nearer home.
Then a game of quoits took place on the commons, as the horses were
having their breath, a good excuse for the men to get a drop of
&ldquo;home-brewed&rdquo; at the Derry Arms. Two miles more, and they
reach home at Blaenplwyf at 9 p.m., after a busy and enjoyable day. A
feast waited them, my grandmother having been busy all day
preparing&mdash;cawl&mdash;new potatoes&mdash;white cabbages&mdash;and
gooseberry tart. She could make delicious food and taught her daughters
also to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">TAI UNNOS (ONE NIGHT HOUSES).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In former times in Wales when the population was
small, much of the land in mountainous regions was a common,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>and the farmers and others were at liberty to send
their cattle and sheep there to graze, and people obtained peat from
such places to burn on the fire. But if a poor family could succeed to
erect a small rude house, or hut in one night on the outskirts of a
common, or a desolate spot on the mountain side, or a dreary dingle,
they claimed from ancient usage their right to the spot. Such a house
was called &ldquo;Ty Unnos&rdquo; (one night house). If a man building
a Ty Unnos of such kind was discovered in building it during the night
by one of his neighbours, people would come and throw it down and
scatter everything, to prevent him taking possession of a place which
they regarded as belonging to all. So that any one building a Ty Unnos
had to do it in one single night, and that secretly, without being
detected. I recollect such a house being built on the mountain of
Llanddewi Brefi many years ago when I was a boy. After securing a house
in this manner the next step was to add land to it, taken and enclosed
patch by patch from the surrounding common, so that quite a farm of
freehold property was created in course of time, if the intrusion
remained unnoticed. But it was necessary for a man to show a great deal
of shrewdness to secure a farm in this manner.</p>
<p class="par">In the parish of Llanarth, Cardiganshire, there is a
spot known as &ldquo;Mynydd Shion Cwilt.&rdquo; According to tradition
this Shion Cwilt was a shrewd and eccentric character who built a
Ty-Unnos, and secured much land from Common.</p>

<p class="par first">In former times, public sarcasm and derision did
much to dispel vice and reform offenders.</p>
<p class="par">In West Wales &ldquo;Ceffyl Pren&rdquo; was resorted to
when a man was supposed to have been unfaithful to his wife whom he had
promised to cherish, or a woman who had broken her marriage
covenant.</p>
<p class="par">It was customary to make a straw man riding a straw
horse, as an effigy to represent the guilty. Such effigies were carried
round the most public places in order to make those who were guilty of
breaking the Seventh Commandment ashamed of themselves. The procession
was a very noisy one, and accompanied by men with horns and brass,
etc., and sometimes a song was composed for the occasion.</p>
<p class="par">Such procession went round the neighbourhood for about
three weeks, and sometimes a gun was carried to shoot the straw rider.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=

<p class="par">At last the effigies were burnt before the house or
houses of the guilty, and then the crowd dispersed.</p>
<p class="par">It is supposed that such custom has come down from the
time of the Druids when it was customary to burn evil-doers in effigies
of straw as sacrifices to the gods.</p>
<p class="par">In some cases people were not satisfied in carrying an
effigy, but seized the guilty man and woman, and carried them publicly
on a ladder for miles round the country.</p>

just small enough to be grasped in one hand. Running with the ball was
the chief method, and the distance between the goals was several
miles.</p>
<p class="par">George Owen, of Henllys, in Pembrokeshire, gives a full
account of Knappan, and how it was played in the time of Queen
Elizabeth, and it seems that the ancient game survived the longest in
the northern part of that county, and the South of Cardiganshire, and
on Corpus Christi Day there was a regular contest between the two
districts, when 2,000 came together, and some horsemen as well. The
game was regarded as the best training for war.</p>

about three or four inches long, with the letters &ldquo;W.N.&rdquo;
marked on it, and in some places it had the following words in full:
&ldquo;Welsh Note, a slap for every time you speak Welsh.&rdquo; This
&ldquo;Welsh Note&rdquo; was in reality nothing but a devise to find
out the children who spoke Welsh, as it was then thought that unless
the mother tongue was banished from Schools, monoglot Welsh children
could not learn English.</p>
<p class="par">During the night-time, of course, the &ldquo;Welsh
Note&rdquo; was in possession of the Schoolmaster, who, when School
began in the morning, gave it secretly to one of the boys with
directions to keep it until he caught some one speaking Welsh, to whom
he was to hand it over, and this boy in his turn was to hand it over to
another delinquent, and so forth. The &ldquo;Welsh Note&rdquo; might
during the day perhaps pass through about twenty different hands; and
at the close of the School in the evening the Schoolmaster would call
for it and the boy in whose possession it was found got the first taste
of the cane on his naked hand; then he returned it to the boy from whom
he got it, and he in like manner was caned in his turn, and so on over
the twenty, more or less, each in his turn getting a taste of the cane,
until the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=

in the present day many old people, and perhaps others, still believe
that such beings did once exist, and that the reason why they are not
now to be seen is that they have been exorcised.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">ORIGIN OF FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Concerning the imaginary origin of the Fairies, it
was once a belief in Wales that they were the souls of the virtuous
Druids, who not having been Christians, could not enter into heaven,
but were too good to be cast into hell!</p>
<p class="par">Another curious belief was that in our Saviour&rsquo;s
time there lived a woman whose fortune it was to be possessed of near a
score of children, and as she saw our Blessed Lord approach her
dwelling, being ashamed of being so prolific, and that He might not see
them all, she concealed about half of them closely, and, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>after
His departure, when she went in search of them, to her surprise she
found they were gone. They never afterwards could be discovered, for it
was supposed that as a punishment from heaven, for hiding what God had
given her, she was deprived of them; and, it is said, these, her
offspring, have generated the race of beings called the Fairies.</p>
<p class="par">As to the realistic origin of the Fairies, according to
the theories of the learned, they were either the ancient Aborigines,
living in seclusion so as to <span class="corr" id="c89" title=
"Corrected by author from: hid">hide</span> themselves from their more
powerful conquerors, or the persecuted Druids living in subterraneous
places, venturing forth only at night. Whether ancient Aborigines
hiding from their conquerors or the Druids who were persecuted by both
Romans and Christians the Rev. P. Roberts, author of &ldquo;Collectana
Cambrica,&rdquo; observes that they used these means to preserve
themselves and their families, and whilst the country was thinly
peopled, and thickly wooded did so successfully, and perhaps to a much
later period than is <span class="corr" id="xd24e2820" title=

though they must have lived there from time immemorial.</p>
<p class="par">They exist in caves, and in their ways recall the
fairies. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; says Sir Harry, &ldquo;to my
thinking, most fairy myths arose from the contemplation of the
mysterious habits of dwarf troglodite races lingering on still in the
crannies, caverns, forests and mountains of Europe, after the invasion
of neolithic man.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Fairies are spoken of as people, or folk, not
as myths or goblins, and yet as spirits they are immortal, and able to
make themselves invisible.</p>
<p class="par">The most general name given them in Wales is &ldquo;Y
Tylwyth Teg,&rdquo; (the Fair Family, or Folk); but they are known
sometimes as &ldquo;Bendith y Mamau&rdquo; (the Mothers&rsquo;
Blessing); and the term &ldquo;gwragedd Annwn,&rdquo; (dames of the
lower regions), is often applied to the Fairy Ladies who dwelt in lakes
or under lakes. Sometimes such terms as &ldquo;Plant Annwn,&rdquo;
(children of the lower regions); Ellyll an elf; Bwbach etc., were
applied to them, but such appellations have never been in common use.
They were also known as &ldquo;Plant Rhys Ddwfn&rdquo; in some parts of
the Vale of Teivy, more especially in the neighbourhood of Cardigan.
But the general term Tylwyth Teg, is known everywhere. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Fairies were small handsome creatures in human
form; very kind to, and often showered benefits on those who treated
them kindly, but most <span class="corr" id="xd24e2843" title=
"Source: revengful">revengeful</span> towards those who dared to treat
them badly. They were dressed in green, and very often in white, and
some of their maidens were so beautiful, that young men sometimes would
fall over head and ears in love with them, especially whilst watching
them dancing on a moonlight night; for the old belief was concerning
the Fairies, that on moonlight nights they were wont to join hands, and
form into circles, and dance and sing with might and main until the
cock crew, then they would vanish.</p>
<p class="par">The circles in the grass of green fields are still
called &ldquo;Cylchau y Tylwyth Teg&rdquo; (Fairy Rings). These circles
were numerous in Wales when I was a boy; and it was believed by many
about forty years ago, if not later that some misfortune would befall
any person entering these circles, for I well remember being warned to
keep away from them. At the present time, however, I do not know of any
person who is afraid of entering them; so it seems that the
superstition respecting the Fairy Rings has entirely died out during
the last generation.</p>
<p class="par">As to their dwellings, the Fairies were &ldquo;things
under the earth,&rdquo; for they were generally supposed to dwell in
the lower regions, especially beneath lakes, where their country towns
and castles were situated; and the people on the coasts of
Pembrokeshire imagined that they inhabited certain enchanted green
isles of the sea.</p>
<p class="par">The green meadows of the sea, called in the old Welsh
Triads Gwerddonau Llion, are the:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Green fairy islands, reposing,</p>
<p class="line">In sunlight and beauty on ocean&rsquo;s calm
breast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">A British King in ancient times, whose name was
Garvan is said to have sailed away in search of these islands, and
never returned. Garvan&rsquo;s voyage is commemorated in the Triads as
one of the &ldquo;Three Losses by Disappearance.&rdquo; Southey after
citing Dr. W. O. Pughe&rsquo;s article in the &ldquo;Cambrian
Biography,&rdquo; goes on as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of these Islands, or Green Spots of the Floods,
there are some singular superstitions. They are the abode of the
Tylwyth Teg, or the fair family, the souls of the virtuous Druids, who
not having been Christians, cannot enter the Christian Heaven, but
enjoy this heaven of their own. They, however, discover a love of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>mischief, neither becoming happy spirits, nor
consistent with their original character; for they love to visit the
earth, and seizing a man, inquire whether he will travel above wind,
mid-wind, or below wind; above wind is a giddy and terrible passage,
below wind is through bush and brake, the middle is a safe course. But
the spell of security is, to catch hold of the grass. In their better
moods they come over and carry the Welsh in their boats. He who visits
these islands imagines on his return that he has been absent only a few
hours, when, in truth, whole centuries have past away. If you take a
turf from St. David&rsquo;s Churchyard, and stand upon it on the sea
shore, you behold these Islands. A man once who thus obtained sight of
them, immediately put to sea to find them; but his search was in vain.
He returned, looked at them again from the enchanted turf, again set
sail, and failed again. The third time he took the turf into his
vessel, and stood upon it till he reached them.&rdquo; Wirt Sikes, in
his &ldquo;British Goblins,&rdquo; page 8, says that there are sailors
on the romantic coasts of Pembrokeshire, and southern Carmarthenshire
who still talk of the green meadows of enchantment, which are visible
sometimes to the eyes of mortals, but only for a brief space, and they
suddenly vanish. He also adds that there are traditions of sailors who,
in the early part of the 19th century, actually went ashore on the
fairy islands&mdash;not knowing that they were such, until they
returned to their boats, when they were filled with awe at seeing the
islands disappear from their sight, neither sinking in the sea, nor
floating away upon the waters, but simply vanishing suddenly. In the
account I have just given, a turf from St. David&rsquo;s Churchyard to
stand upon enabled one to behold the enchanted lands of the Fairies;
but according to traditions in other parts of the country, it seems
that a certain spot in Cemmes was the requisite platform, to see these
mythical beings who were known in some parts as Plant Rhys Ddwfn
(Children of Rhys the Deep).</p>
<p class="par">In the Brython, Vol. I., page 130, Gwynionydd says as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is a tale current in Dyfed, that there is,
or rather that there has been a country between Cemmes, the Northern
Hundred of Pembrokeshire, and Aberdaron in Lleyn. The chief patriarch

called after him the Children of Rhys Ddwfn.</p>

herbs grew in any other part of the world, excepting on a small spot, a

man stood alone on it, he beheld the whole of the territory of Plant
Rhys Ddwfn; but the moment he moved he would lose sight of it
altogether, and it would have been nearly vain to look for his
footprints.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Several versions have appeared from time to time
of this story, but the most complete one is the one which appeared in
Mr. Rees, of Tonn, in his interesting introduction to &ldquo;The
Physicians of Myddvai,&rdquo; published by the Welsh Manuscript
Society, at Llandovery, in 1861; and this is also the version which was
reproduced by Principal Sir J. Rhys, of Oxford, in his great work on
Celtic Folk-lore.</p>
<p class="par">About five years ago, I came across several old persons
in the parish of Myddvai, who could repeat portions of the story, but
nothing new, so I give the version of Mr. Rees of Tonn, which is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When the eventful struggle made by the Princes of
South Wales to preserve the independency of their country was drawing
to its close in the twelfth century, there lived at Blaensawdde, near
Llandeusant, Carmarthenshire, a widowed woman, the relict of a farmer
who had fallen in those disastrous troubles. The widow had an only son
to bring up, but Providence smiled upon her, and despite her forlorn
condition, her live stock had so increased in course of time, that she
could not well depasture them upon her farm, so she sent a portion of
her cattle to graze on the adjoining Black Mountain, and their most
favourite place was near the small lake called Llyn y Fan Fach, on the
north-western side of the Carmarthenshire Fans.</p>
<p class="par">The son grew up to manhood, and was generally sent by
his mother to look after the cattle on the mountain. One day, in his
peregrinations along the margin of the lake, to his great astonishment,
he beheld sitting on the unruffled surface of the water, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>lady,
one of the most beautiful creatures that mortal eyes ever beheld, her
hair flowed gracefully in ringlets over her shoulders, the tresses of
which she arranged with a comb, whilst the glassy surface of her watery
couch served for the purpose of a mirror, reflecting back her own
image. Suddenly she beheld the young man standing on the brink of the
lake, with his eyes riveted on her, and unconsciously offering to
herself the provision of barley bread and cheese with which he had been
provided when he left his home.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bewildered by a feeling of love and admiration
for the object before him, he continued to hold out his hand towards
the lady, who imperceptibly glided near to him, but gently refused the
offer of his provisions. He attempted to touch her, but she eluded his
grasp, saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cras dy fara;</p>

<p class="line">Hard baked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis not easy to catch me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">and immediately dived under the water and
disappeared, leaving the love-stricken youth to return home, a prey to
disappointment and regret that he had been unable to make further
acquaintance with one, in comparison with whom the whole of the fair
maidens of Llanddeusant and Myddfai whom he had ever seen were as
nothing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On his return home, the young man communicated to
his mother the extraordinary vision he had beheld. She advised him to
take some unbaked dough or &ldquo;toes&rdquo; the next time in his
pocket, as there must have been some spell connected with the
hard-baked bread, or &ldquo;Bara cras,&rdquo; which prevented his
catching the lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Next morning, before the sun had gilded with its
rays the peaks of the Fans, the young man was at the lake, not for the
purpose of looking after his mother&rsquo;s cattle, but seeking for the
same enchanting vision he had witnessed the day before; but all in vain
did he anxiously strain his eyeballs and glance over the surface of the
lake, as only the ripples occasioned by a stiff breeze met his view,
and a cloud hung heavily on the summits of the Fan, which imparted an
additional gloom to his already distracted mind.</p>
<p class="par">Hours passed on, the wind was hushed, and the clouds
which had enveloped the mountain had vanished into thin air before the
powerful beams of the sun, when the youth was startled by seeing some
of his mother&rsquo;s cattle on the precipitous side of the acclivity,
nearly on the opposite side of the lake. His duty impelled him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>to attempt to rescue them from their perilous
position, for which purpose he was hastening away, when to his
inexpressible delight, the object of his search again appeared to him
as before, and seemed much more beautiful than when he first beheld
her. His hand was again held out to her, full of unbaked bread, which
he offered with an urgent proffer of his heart also, and vows of
eternal attachment. All of which were refused by her saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Llaith dy fara,</p>
<p class="line">Ti ni fynna&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(Unbaked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">I will not have thee.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">But the smiles that played upon her features as
the lady vanished beneath the waters raised within the young man a hope
that forbade him to despair by her refusal of him, and the recollection
of which cheered him on his way home. His aged parent was made
acquainted with his ill-success, and she suggested that his bread
should next time be but slightly baked, as most likely to please the
mysterious being of whom he had become enamoured.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Impelled by an irresistible feeling, the youth
left his mother&rsquo;s house early next morning, and with rapid steps
he passed over the mountain. He was soon near the margin of the lake,
and with all the impatience of an ardent lover did he wait with a
feverish anxiety for the reappearance of the mysterious lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The sheep and goats browsed on the precipitous
sides of the Fan; the cattle strayed amongst the rocks and large
stones, some of which were occasionally loosened from their beds and
suddenly rolled down into the lake; rain and sunshine alike came and
passed away; but all were unheeded by the youth, so wrapped up was he
in looking for the appearance of the lady.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The freshness of the early morning had
disappeared before the sultry rays of the noon-day sun, which in its
turn was fast verging towards the west as the evening was dying away
and making room for the shades of night, and hope had well nigh abated
of beholding once more the Lady of the Lake. The young man cast a sad
and last farewell look over the water, and to his astonishment, beheld
several cows walking along its surface. The sight of these animals
caused hope to revive that they would be followed by another object far
more pleasing; nor was he disappointed, for the maiden reappeared, and
to his enraptured sight, even lovelier than ever. She approached the
land, and he rushed to meet her in the water. A smile encouraged him to
seize her hand; neither did she refuse the moderately baked bread he
offered her; and after some persuasion she consented to become his
bride, on condition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>that they should only live together until she
received from him three blows without a cause,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="cy" class="line">&ldquo;Tri ergyd diachos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">(Three causeless blows.)</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">and if he ever should happen to strike her three
such blows she would leave him for ever. To such conditions he readily
consented and would have consented to any other stipulation, had it
been proposed, as he was only intent on then securing such a lovely
creature for his wife.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Thus the Lady of the Lake engaged to become the
young man&rsquo;s wife, and having loosened her hand for a moment she
darted away and dived into the lake. His chagrin and grief were such
that he determined to cast himself headlong into the deepest water, so
as to end his life in the element that had contained in its unfathomed
depths the only one for whom he cared to live on earth. As he was on
the point of committing this rash act, there emerged out of the lake
two most beautiful ladies, accompanied by a hoary-headed man of noble
mien and extraordinary stature, but having otherwise all the force and
strength of youth. This man addressed the almost bewildered youth in
accents calculated to soothe his troubled mind, saying that as he
proposed to marry one of his daughters, he consented to the union,
provided the young man could distinguish which of the two ladies before
him was the object of his affections. This was no easy task, as the
maidens were such perfect counterparts of each other that it seemed
quite impossible for him to choose his bride, and if perchance he fixed
upon the wrong one all would be for ever lost.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whilst the young man narrowly scanned the two
ladies, he could not perceive the least difference betwixt the two, and
was almost giving up the task in despair, when one of them thrust her
foot a slight degree forward. The motion, simple as it was, did not
escape the observation of the youth, and he discovered a trifling
variation in the mode with which their sandals were tied. This at once
put an end to the dilemma, for he, who had on previous occasions been
so taken up with the general appearance of the Lady of the Lake, had
also noticed the beauty of her feet and ankles, and on now recognising
the peculiarity of her shoe-tie he boldly took hold of her hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou hast chosen rightly,&rsquo; said her
father, &lsquo;be to her a kind and faithful husband, and I will give
her, as a dowry, as many sheep, cattle, goats, and horses as she can
count of each without heaving or drawing in her breath. But remember,
that if you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>prove unkind to her at any time, and strike her
three times without a cause, she shall return to me, and shall bring
all her stock back with her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Such was the verbal marriage settlement, to which the
young man gladly assented, and his bride was desired to count the
number of sheep she was to have.</p>
<p class="par">She immediately adopted the mode of counting by fives,
thus:&mdash;one, two, three, four, five&mdash;one, two, three,
four<span class="corr" id="xd24e2960" title="Source: ;">,</span> five;
and as many times as possible in rapid succession, till her breath was
exhausted. The same procession of reckoning had to determine the number
of goat, cattle, and horses respectively; and in an instant the full
number of each came out of the lake when called upon by the father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The young couple were then married, by what
ceremony was not stated, and afterwards went to reside at a farm called
Esgair Llaethy, somewhat more than a mile from the Village of Myddfai,
where they lived in prosperity and happiness for several years, and
became the parents of three sons, who were beautiful children.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a christening to take
place in the neighbourhood, to which the parents were specially
invited. When the day arrived the wife appeared very reluctant to
attend the christening, alleging that the distance was too great for
her to walk. Her husband told her to fetch one of the horses which were
grazing in an adjoining field. &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;if you will bring me my gloves which I left in our
house.<span class="corr" id="xd24e2967" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> He went to the house and returned with
the gloves, and finding that she had not gone for the horse jocularly
slapped her shoulder with one of them, saying, &lsquo;go! go!&rsquo;
(dos, dos), when she reminded him of the understanding upon which she
consented to marry him:&mdash;That he was not to strike her without a
cause; and warned him to be more cautious for the future.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On another occasion, when they were together at a
wedding in the midst of the mirth and hilarity of the assembled guests,
who had gathered together from all the surrounding country, she burst
into tears and sobbed most piteously. Her husband touched her on her
shoulder and inquired the cause of her weeping: she said, &lsquo;Now
people are entering into trouble, and your troubles are likely to
commence, as you have the second time stricken me without a
cause.&rsquo;<a id="xd24e2972" name="xd24e2972"></a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Years passed on, and their children had grown up,
and were particularly clever young men. In the midst of so many worldly
blessings at home, the husband almost forgot that there remained only
one causeless blow to be given to destroy the whole of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>prosperity. Still he was watchful lest any trivial
occurrence should take place which his wife must regard as a breach of
their marriage contract. She told him, as her affection for him was
unabated, to be careful that he would not, through some inadvertence,
give the last and only blow, which, by an unalterable destiny over
which she had no control, would separate them for ever.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It, however, so happened that one day they were
together at a funeral, where, in the midst of the mourning and grief at
the house of the deceased, she appeared in the highest and gayest
spirits, and indulged in immoderate fits of laughter, which so shocked
her husband that he touched her, saying: &lsquo;Hush! hush! don&rsquo;t
laugh.&rsquo; She said that she laughed &lsquo;because people when they
die go out of trouble,&rsquo; and rising up she went out of the house,
saying, &lsquo;The last blow has been struck, our marriage contract is
broken, and at an end! Farewell!&rsquo; Then she started off towards
Esgair Llaethdy, where she called her cattle and other stock together,
each by name. The cattle she called thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">They all immediately obeyed the summons of their
mistress. The &lsquo;little black calf,&rsquo; although it had been
slaughtered, became alive again, and walked off with the rest of the
stock at the command of the lady. This happened in the spring of the
year, and there were from four oxen ploughing in one of the fields; to
these she cried:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">Away the whole of the live stock went with the
Lady across Myddfai Mountain, towards the lake from whence they came, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>distance of above six miles, where they
disappeared beneath its waters, leaving no trace behind except a
well-marked furrow, which was made by the plough the oxen drew after
them into the lake, and which remains to this day as a testimony to the
truth of this story.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What became of the affrighted
ploughman&mdash;whether he was left on the field when the oxen set off,
or whether he followed them to the lake, has not been handed down to
tradition; neither has the fate of the disconsolate and half-ruined
husband been kept in remembrance. But of the sons it is stated that
they often wandered about the lake and its vicinity, hoping that their
mother might be permitted to visit the face of the earth once more, as
they had been apprised of her mysterious origin, her first appearance
to their father, and the untoward circumstances which so unhappily
deprived them of her maternal care.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In one of their rambles, at a place near Dol
Howel, at the Mountain Gate, still called &lsquo;Llidiad y
Meddygon,&rsquo; (The Physician&rsquo;s Gate), the mother appeared
suddenly, and accosted her eldest son, whose name was Rhiwallon, and
told him that his mission on earth was to be a benefactor to mankind by
relieving them from pain and misery, through healing all manner of
their diseases; for which purpose she furnished him with a bag full of
medical prescriptions and instructions for the preservation of health.
That by strict attention thereto he and his family would become for
many generations the most skilful physicians in the country. Then,
promising to meet him when her counsel was most needed, she vanished.
But on several occasions she met her sons near the banks of the lake,
and once she even accompanied them on their return home as far as a
place still called &lsquo;Pant-y-Meddygon,&rsquo; (The dingle of the
Physicians) where she pointed out to them the various plants and herbs
which grew in the dingle, and revealed to them their medicinal
qualities or virtues; and the knowledge she imparted to them, together
with their unrivalled skill, soon caused them to attain such celebrity
that none ever possessed before them. And in order that their knowledge
should not be lost, they wisely committed the same to writing for the
benefit of mankind throughout all ages.</p>
<p class="par">And so ends the story of the Physicians of Myddfai,
which had been handed down from one generation to another,
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Yr hen wr llwyd o&rsquo;r cornel,</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;The grey old man in the corner</p>
<p class="line">Of his father heard a story,</p>
<p class="line">Which from his father he had heard,</p>
<p class="line">And after them I have remembered.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The Physicians of Myddfai were Rhiwallon and his
sons, Cadwgan, Gruffydd and Einion, who became Physicians to Rhys Gryg,
Lord of Llandovery and Dynefor Castles, who lived in the early part of
the thirteenth century. Rhys &ldquo;gave them rank, lands, and
privileges at Myddfai for their maintenance in the practice of their
art and science, and the healing and benefit of those who should seek
their help.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The fame of the celebrated Physicians was soon
established over the whole country, and continued for centuries among
their descendants; and the celebrated Welsh Poet Dafydd ap Gwilym, who
flourished in the fourteenth century, says in one of his poems when
alluding to these physicians:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Meddyg, nis gwnai modd y gwnaeth</p>
<p class="line">Myddfai, o chai ddyn meddfaeth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(A Physician he would not make</p>
<p class="line">As Myddfai made, if he had a mead fostered man.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">Mr. Rees says that &ldquo;of the above lands
bestowed upon the Meddygon, there are two farms in the Myddfai parish
still called &ldquo;Llwyn Ifan Feddyg,&rdquo; the Grove of Evan, the
Physician, and &ldquo;Llwyn Meredydd Feddyg&rdquo; (the Grove of
Meredydd the Physician). Esgair Llaethdy, mentioned in the foregoing
legend, was formerly in the possession of the above descendants, and so
was Ty-newydd, near Myddfai, which was purchased by Mr. Holford, of
Cilgwyn, from the Rev. Charles Lloyd, vicar of Llandefalle,
Breconshire, who married a daughter of one of the Meddygon, and had the
living of Llandefalle from a Mr. Vaughan, who presented him to the same
out of gratitude, because Mr. Lloyd, wife&rsquo;s father had cured him
of a disease in the eye. As Mr. Lloyd succeeded to the above living in
1748, and died in 1800, it is probable that that skilful oculist was
John Jones, who is mentioned in the following inscription on a
tombstone at present fixed against the west end of Myddfai</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first xd24e190">HERE<br>

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=

<p class="par">These appear to have been the last of the Physicians who
practised at Myddfai. The above John Jones resided for some time at
Llandovery, and was a very eminent surgeon. One of his descendants,
named John Lewis, lived at Cwmbran, Myddfai, at which place his
great-grandson, Mr. John Jones, now resides.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dr. Morgan Owen, Bishop of Llandaff, who died at
Glasallt, parish of Myddfai, in 1645, was a descendant of the Meddygon,
and an inheritor of much of their landed property in that parish, the
bulk of which he bequeathed to his nephew, Morgan Owen, who died in
1667, and was succeeded by his son Henry Owen; and at the decease of
the last of whose descendants, Roberts Lewis, Esqr., the estates
became, through the will of one of the family, the property of the late
D. A. S. Davies, Esqr., M.P., for Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bishop Owen bequeathed to another nephew, Morgan
ap Rees, son of Rees ap John, a descendant of the Meddygon, the farm of
Rhyblid, and some other property.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Amongst other families who claim descent from the
Physicians were the Bowens of Cwmydw, Myddfai, and Jones of Dollgarreg
and Penrhock, in the same parish; the latter of whom are represented by
Charles Bishop, of Dollgarreg, Esqr., Clerk of the Peace for
Carmarthenshire, and Thomas Bishop, of Brecon, Esqr.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Rees Williams, of Myddfai, is recorded as one of
the Meddygon. His great grandson was the late Rice Williams, M.D., of
Aberystwyth, who died May l6th, 1842, aged 85, and appears to have been
the last, although not the least eminent of the Physicians descended
from the mysterious Lady of Llyn y Fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sir John Rhys mentions of another Dr. Williams also a
descendant of the Lady of Llyn y Fan, who was living at Aberystwyth in
1881.</p>
<p class="par">It seems that there are several families in different
parts of Wales who are said to have fairy blood coursing through their
veins; and the noble Lady Bulkeley, who lived in North Wales, three or
four generations was supposed to be descended from a Fairy lady who
married a mortal.</p>
<p class="par">There is also a tradition that after the disappearance
of the lady the disconsolate husband and his friends set to work to
drain the lake in order to get at her, if possible; but as they were
making a cutting into the bank a huge monster emerged from the water
and threatened to drown the town of Brecon for disturbing him,
saying:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=

<p class="line">(If I get no quiet in my place</p>
<p class="line">I shall drown the town of Brecon).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">so they had to give up draining the lake.</p>
<p class="par">There are extant several versions of the Myddfai Legend.
In the &ldquo;Cambro Briton&rdquo; Vol. II., pages 313&ndash;315, we
have a version in which it is stated that the farmer used to go near
the lake and see some lambs he had bought at a fair, and that wherever
he so went three most beautiful maidens appeared to him from the lake.
But whenever he tried to catch them they ran away into the lake,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Cras dy fara,</p>
<p class="line">Anhawdd ein dala.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(For thee who eatest baked bread</p>
<p class="line">It is difficult to catch us.)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">But one day a piece of moist bread came floating
ashore, which he ate, and the next day he had a chat with the maidens.
After a little conversation he proposed marriage to one of them, to
which she consented, provided he could distinguish her from her sisters
the day after. Then the story goes on very similar to Mr. Rees&rsquo;
version which I have already given in full.</p>
<p class="par">In another beautiful version of the story which is given
by Sikes in his &ldquo;British Goblins,&rdquo; it is said that an
enamoured farmer had heard of the lake maiden, who rowed up and down
the lake in a golden boat, with a golden oar. Her hair was long and
yellow, and her face was pale and melancholy. In his desire to see this
wondrous beauty, the farmer went on New Year&rsquo;s Eve to the edge of
the lake and in silence, awaited the coming of the first hour of the
new year. It came, and there in truth was the maiden in her golden
boat, rowing softly to and fro. Fascinated, he stood for hours
beholding her, until the stars faded out of the sky, the moon sank
behind the rocks, and the cold gray dawn drew nigh; and then the maiden
began to vanish from his sight. Wild with passion, he cried aloud to
the retreating vision, &ldquo;Stay! Stay! Be my wife.&rdquo; But the
maiden only uttered a faint cry, and was gone. Night after night the
young farmer haunted the shores of the lake, but the maiden returned no
more. He became negligent of his person; his once robust form grew thin
and wan; his face was a map of melancholy and despair. He went one day
to consult a soothsayer who dwelt on the mountain, and this grave
personage advised him to besiege the damsel&rsquo;s heart with gifts of
bread and cheese. This counsel commending itself strongly to his Welsh
way of thinking, the former set out upon an assiduous course of casting
his bread upon the waters&mdash;accompanied by cheese. He began on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>Mid-summer Eve by going to the lake and dropping
therein a large cheese and a loaf of bread. Night after night he
continued to throw in loaves and cheeses, but nothing appeared in
answer to his sacrifices. His hopes were set, however, on the
approaching New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The momentous night arrived at last.
Clad in his best array, and armed with seven white loaves and his
biggest and handsomest cheese, he set out once more for the lake. Then
he waited till mid-night, and then slowly and solemnly dropped the
seven loaves into the water, and with a sigh sent the cheese to keep
them company. His persistence was at length rewarded. The Lake Lady
came in her skiff to where he was, and gracefully stepped ashore. The
story then proceeds as in the other versions.</p>
<p class="par">It was once a custom for people to go up to the lake on
the first Sunday in August, when its water was supposed to be boiling;
and Bishop Edwards, of St. Asaph, informed Professor Sir J. Rhys, that
&ldquo;an old woman from Myddfai, who is now, that is to say in
January, 1881, about eighty years of age, tells me that she remembers
<a id="xd24e3157" name="xd24e3157"></a>thousands and thousands of
people visiting the Lake of Little Fan on the first Sunday or Monday in
August, and when she was young she often heard old men declare that at
that time a commotion took place in the lake, and that its waters
boiled, which was taken to herald the approach of the Lake Lady and her
oxen.&rdquo;&mdash;Celtic Folk Lore&mdash;page 15.</p>

<h3 class="main">A STUDENT WHO HAD FAILED TO PASS HIS EXAMINATIONS
TAUGHT BY THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. John Jones, of Pontrhydfendigaid, an old man
of over 95 years of age, related to me the following story about seven
years ago:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">In the 18th century there was a certain clergyman in
North Cardiganshire, who was supposed to have been educated by the
Fairies.</p>
<p class="par">When he was a boy, his parents were very ambitious to
see their son a clergyman, but, unfortunately, the lad either neglected
his studies, or was a regular &ldquo;blockhead,&rdquo; and always
failed to pass his college examinations, to the great regret and
disappointment of his father and mother. One day, however, when the boy
was roaming about the country (near the banks of the river Rheidol, as
far as Mr. Jones could remember the story), he suddenly met three boys,
or rather three little men who were not bigger than boys, who took him
into some cave and led him along a subterranean passage into the land
of the Fairies. The Fairies proved very kind to him, and when they
heard his story, they undertook <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>to help him to learn his
lessons, so that in course of time he acquired a considerable knowledge
of the classics. After spending a certain number of years very happily
in Fairy Land, the young man returned to the world of mortals, and to
the great joy of his parents passed his examinations now without the
least difficulty, and in due time was ordained by the bishop, and
became a vicar of a parish north of Aberystwyth, either Llanfihangel,
Llancynfelin, or Eglwysfach.</p>
<p class="par">This tale seems to be a version of the Story of
Elidorus, which Giraldus Cambrensis heard in the neighbourhood of
Swansea during his &ldquo;Itinerary through Wales,&rdquo; with
Archbishop Baldwin in the year 1188, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A short time before our days, a circumstance
worthy of note occurred in these parts, which Elidorus, a priest, most
strenuously affirmed had befallen himself. <a id="xd24e3174" name=
"xd24e3174"></a>When a youth of twelve years, and learning his letters,
since, as Solomon says, &ldquo;The root of learning is bitter, although
the fruit is sweet,&rdquo; in order to avoid the discipline and
frequent stripes inflicted on him by his perceptor, he ran away, and
concealed himself under the hollow bank of a river. After fasting in
that situation for two days, two little men of pigmy stature appeared
to him, saying, &lsquo;If you come with us, we will lead you into a
country full of delights and sports.&rsquo; &ldquo;Assenting, and
rising up, he followed his guides through a path, at first
subterraneous and dark, into a most beautiful country, adorned with
rivers and meadows, woods and plains, but obscure, and not illuminated
with the full light of the sun.&rdquo; All the days were cloudy, and
the nights extremely dark, on account of the absence of the moon and
stars. <a id="xd24e3176" name="xd24e3176"></a>The boy was brought
before the King, and introduced to him in the presence of the court;
who, having examined him for a long time, delivered him to his son, who
was then a, boy. &ldquo;These men were of the smallest stature, but
very well proportioned in their make; they were all of a fair
complexion, with luxuriant hair falling over their shoulders like that
of women. &ldquo;They had horses and greyhounds adapted to their size.
&ldquo;They neither ate flesh nor fish, but lived on milk diet, made up
into messes with saffron. &ldquo;They never took an oath, for they
detested nothing so much as lies. &ldquo;As often as they returned from
our upper hemisphere, they reprobated our ambition, infidelities, and
inconstances; they had no form of public worship, being strict lovers
and reverers, as it seemed, of truth. &ldquo;The boy frequently
returned to our hemisphere, sometimes by the way he had first gone,
sometimes by another; at first in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104"
href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>company with other persons,
and afterwards alone, and made himself known only to his mother,
declaring to her the manners, nature and state of that people.
&ldquo;Being desired by her to bring a present of gold, with which that
region abounded, he stole, while at play with the King&rsquo;s son, the
golden ball with which he used to divert himself, and brought it to his
mother in great haste; and when he reached the door of his
father&rsquo;s house, but not unpursued, and was entering it in a great
hurry, his foot stumbled on the threshold, and falling down into the
room where his mother was sitting, the two pigmies seized the ball
which had dropped from his hand, and departed, showing the boy every
mark of contempt and derision. &ldquo;On recovering from his fall,
confounded with shame, and execrating the evil counsel of his mother,
he returned by the usual track to the subterraneous road, but found no
appearance of any passage, though he searched for it on the banks of
the river for nearly the space of a year. &ldquo;But since those
calamities are often alleviated by time, which reason cannot mitigate,
and length of time alone blunts the edge of our afflictions, and puts
an end to many evils, the youth having been brought back by his friends
and mother, and restored to his right way of thinking, and to his
learning, in process of time attained the rank of priesthood.
&ldquo;Whenever David II., bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, talked to him
in his advanced state of life concerning this event, he could never
relate the particulars without shedding tears. &ldquo;He had made
himself acquainted with the language of that nation, the words of
which, in his younger days he used to recite, which, as the bishop
often had informed me, were very conformable to the Greek idiom.
&ldquo;When they asked for water, they said &lsquo;<span lang="cy">ydor
ydorum</span>,&rsquo; which meant bring water, for &lsquo;<span lang=
"cy">ydor</span>&rsquo; in their language, as well as in Greek,
signifies water, from whence vessels for water are caller
&lsquo;udriai&rsquo;; and &lsquo;Dur&rsquo; (<span lang=
"cy">dwr</span>) also, in the British language (Welsh) signifies
water.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When they wanted salt they said,
&lsquo;<span lang="cy">Halgein ydorum</span>,&rsquo; bring salt: salt
is called &lsquo;al&rsquo; in Greek, and &lsquo;halen&rsquo; in
British, for that language, from the length of time which the Britons
(then called Trojans, and afterwards Britons, from Brito, their
leader), remained in Greece after the destruction of Troy, became in
many instances, similar to the Greek.... &ldquo;If a scrupulous
inquirer asks my opinion of the relation here inserted, I answer with
Augustine, &lsquo;that the Divine miracles are to be admired, not
discussed.&rsquo; &ldquo;Nor do I, by denial, place bounds to the
Divine Power, nor, by assent, insolently extend what cannot be
extended. &ldquo;But I always call to mind the saying of St. Jerome:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>&lsquo;You will find,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;Many things incredible and improbable, which nevertheless are
true; for nature cannot in any respect prevail against the Lord of
nature.&rsquo; &ldquo;These things, therefore, and similar
contingencies, I should place, according to the opinion of Augustine,
among those particulars which are neither to be affirmed, nor too
positively denied.&rdquo; The above account is of the greatest
interest, as it was written 700 years ago, and it also gives the
opinion of one who lived in those days, of &ldquo;these things, and
similar contingencies.&rdquo; It is possible that many of the Fairy
Tales throughout the Kingdom, if not throughout the whole of Europe,
have been founded on the story of Elidorus, the priest.</p>

FRENIFAWR<span class="corr" id="xd24e3201" title=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following story appeared in the
&ldquo;Cambrian Superstitions,&rdquo; by W. Howells, a little book
published at Tipton in 1831:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">A stripling, of twelve or more years of age, was tending
his father&rsquo;s sheep on a small mountain called Frenifach, it was a
fine morning in June, and he had just driven the sheep to their pasture
for the day, when he looked at the top of Frenifawr to observe which
way the morning fog declined, that he might judge the weather.</p>
<p class="par">If the fog on Frenifawr (a high mountain in
Pembrokeshire, 10 miles from Cardigan) declines to the Pembrokeshire
side, the peasants prognosticated fair, if on the Cardiganshire side
foul weather.</p>
<p class="par">To his surprise the boy saw what seemed a party of
soldiers sedulously engaged in some urgent affair; knowing there could
not possibly be soldiers there so early, he with some alarm, looked
more minutely, and perceived they were too diminutive for men; yet,
thinking his eyesight had deceived him, he went to a more elevated
situation, and discovered that they were the &ldquo;Tylwyth Teg&rdquo;
(Fairies) dancing. He had often heard of them and had seen their rings
in the neighbourhood, but not till then had the pleasure of seeing
them; he once thought of running home to acquaint his parents, but
judging they would be gone before he returned, and he be charged with a
falsehood, he resolved to go up to them, for he had been informed that
the fairies were very harmless, and would only injure those who
attempted to discover their habitation, so by degrees he arrived within
a short distance of the ring, where he remained some time observing
their motions. They were of both sexes, and he described them as being
the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>handsome people he had ever seen, they also
appeared enchantingly cheerful, as if inviting him to enter and join
the dance.</p>
<p class="par">They did not all dance, but those who did, never
deviated from the circle; some ran after one another with surprising
swiftness, and others (females), rode on small white horses of the most
beautiful form. Their dresses, although indescribably elegant, and
surpassing the sun in radiance, varied in colour, some being white,
others scarlet, and the males wore a red triplet cap, but the females
some light head-dress, which waved fantastically with the slightest
breeze. He had not remained long ere they made signs for him to enter,
and he gradually drew nearer till at length he ventured to place one
foot in the circle, which he had no sooner done than his ears were
charmed with the most melodious music, which moved him in the transport
of the moment, to enter altogether; he was no sooner in than he found
himself in a most elegant palace, glittering with gold and pearls; here
he enjoyed every variety of pleasure, and had the liberty to range
whatever he pleased, accompanied by kind attendants beautiful as the
howries; and instead of &ldquo;Tatws a llaeth,&rdquo; buttermilk, or
fresh boiled flummery, here were the choicest viands and the purest
wine in abundance, brought in golden goblets inlaid with gems,
sometimes by invisible agency, and at other times by the most beautiful
virgins. He had only one restriction, and that was not to drink, upon
any consideration (or it was told him it would be fatal to his
happiness), from a certain well in the middle of the garden, which
contained golden fishes and others of various colours. New objects
daily attracts his attention, and new faces presented themselves to his
view, surpassing, if possible those he had seen before; new pastimes
were continually invented to charm him, but one day his hopes were
blasted, and all his happiness fled in an instant. Possessing that
innate curiosity nearly common to all, he, like our first parents
transgressed, and plunged his hand into the well, when the fishes
instantly disappeared, and, putting the water to his mouth, he heard a
confused shriek run through the garden: in an instant after, the palace
and all vanished away, and to his horror, he found himself in the very
place where he first entered the ring, and the scenes around, with the
same sheep grazing, were just as he had left them. He could scarcely
believe himself, and hoped again, that he was in the magnificent fairy
castle; he looked around, but the scene was too well known; his senses
soon returned to their proper action, and his memory proved that,
although he thought he had been absent so many years, he had been so
only so many minutes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This tale bears a strange contrast as regards the time
the boy thought he was away, to most of our fairy tales which represent
those who had the pleasure of being with fairies as imagining they had
been dancing only a few minutes, when they had been away for years.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rev. Z. M. Davies, Vicar of Llanfihangel
Genau&rsquo;r Glyn, told me that he once heard an old man in the Vale
of Aeron saying that when he was out late one night, he heard the
Fairies singing, and that their music was so delightful that he
listened to them for hours; and we find from many of the Fairy Tales
that one of their chief occupation in their nightly revels was singing
and dancing, and that they often succeeded in inducing men through the
allurements of music to join their ranks.</p>
<p class="par">The beautiful old Welsh Air, &ldquo;Toriad y Dydd&rdquo;
(Dawn of Day) is supposed to have been composed by the Fairies, and
which they chanted just as the pale light in the east announced the
approach of returning day.</p>
<p class="par">The following &ldquo;Can y Tylwyth Teg,&rdquo; or the

<h3 class="main">A FARM SERVANT NEAR TREGARON, WHO SPENT A YEAR AND A
DAY WITH THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following story appeared in
&ldquo;Cymru&rdquo; for May, 1893, a Welsh Magazine, edited by Owen M.
Edwards, M.A. It was written in Welsh by the late eminent Folk-Lorist,
Mr. D. Lledrod Davies, and I translate it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The farm-house called &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Allt
Ddu</span>,&rdquo; is situated about half-way between Pont Rhyd
Fendigaid and Tregaron.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that two servant men went out of the house
one evening in search for the cattle, which had gone astray. One of the
men proceeded in one direction and the other in another way, so as to
be more sure of finding the animals.</p>
<p class="par">But after wandering about for hours, one of the two
servants came home, but whether he found the cattle or not it is not
stated. However, he reached home safely; but the other man, his
fellow-servant, came not, and after anxiously expecting him till a late
hour of night, he began to feel very uneasy concerning his safety,
fearing that the lad had accidentally fallen into some of the pits of
the Gors Goch. Next morning came, but the servant came not home; and in
vain did they long to hear the sound of his footsteps approaching the
house as before.</p>
<p class="par">Then inquiries were made about him, and people went to
try and find him, but all in vain. Days past and even weeks without
hearing anything about him, till at last his relations began to suspect
that his fellow servant had murdered him during the night they were out
looking for the cattle. So the servant was summoned before a Court of
Justice, and accused of having murdered his fellow-servant on a certain
night; but the young man, pleaded not guilty in a most decided manner,
and as no witness could be found against him, the case was dismissed;
but many people were still very suspicious of him, and the loss of his
fellow servant continued <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>to be a black spot on his
character. However, it was decided at last to go to the &ldquo;dyn
hysbys,&rdquo; (a wise man, or a conjurer)&mdash;a man of great repute
in former days,&mdash;to consult with him, and to set the case before
him exactly as it had happened. After going and explaining everything
to the conjurer concerning the lost servant, he informed them that the
young man was still alive.</p>
<p class="par">He then told them to go to a certain place at the same
time of night, one year and a day from the time the man was lost, and
that they should then and there see him. One year and a day at last
passed away, and at that hour the family, and especially the servant,
traced their steps to the particular spot pointed out by the conjuror,
and there, to their great surprise, whom should they see within the
Fairy Circle, dancing as merrily as any, but the lost servant. And now,
according to the directions which had been given by the conjurer, the
other servant took hold of the collar of the coat of the one who was
dancing, and dragged him out of the circle, saying to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Where hast thou been lad?&rdquo; But the lad&rsquo;s
first words were, &ldquo;Did you find the cattle?&rdquo; for he thought
that he had been with the Fairies only for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="par">Then he explained how he entered the Fairy Circle, and
how he was seized by them, but found their company so delightful that
he thought he had been with them only for a few minutes.</p>

&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Ystraeon y Gwyll</span>,&rdquo; by the late D.
Lledrod Davies:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There lived in an old farm house on the banks of
the Teivy, a respectable family, and in order to carry on the work of
the farm successfully, they kept men servants and maid servants.</p>
<p class="par">One afternoon, a servant-man and a servant girl went out
to look for the cows, but as they were both crossing a marshy flat, the
man suddenly missed the girl, and after much shouting and searching, no
sound of her voice could be heard replying. He then took home the cows,
and informed the family of the mysterious disappearance of the servant
maid which took place so suddenly. As the Fairies were suspected, it
was resolved to go to the dyn hysbys (wise man).</p>
<p class="par">To him they went, and he informed them that the girl was
with the Fairies, and that they could get her back from them, by being
careful to go to a certain spot at the proper time at the end of a year
and a day. They did as they were directed by the &ldquo;wise
man,&rdquo; and to their great surprise, found the maid among
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>the fairies dancing and singing with them, and
seemed as happy as a fish in the water. Then they successfully drew her
out of the ring, and they took her home safely. The master had been
told by the &ldquo;Wise Man&rdquo; that the girl was not to be touched
by iron, or she would disappear at once after getting her out of the
ring.</p>
<p class="par">One day, however, when her master was about to start
from home, and whilst he was getting the horse and cart ready, he asked
the girl to assist him, which she did willingly; but as he was bridling
the horse, the bit touched the girl and she disappeared instantly, and
was never seen from that day forth.</p>

boy servant, whom she sent one evening to the neighbouring village with
a bottle to get some barm for her, and as he had to pass through a
field which was frequented by the Fairies, he was told by the old woman
to keep away from their circles or rings. The boy reached the village,
got the barm, and in due time proceeded on his homeward journey, but
did not reach home. Search was made for him in all directions, and
people were able to trace his steps as far as the Fairies&rsquo; field,
but no further, so it was evident that the Fairies had seized him. At
the end of a year and a day, however, to the great surprise of
everybody, the boy came home, entered the house, with the bottle of
barm in hand, and handed it to the old woman as if nothing unusual had
happened. The boy was greatly surprised when he was told that he had
been away for twelve months and a day. Then he related how he fell in
with the Fairies, whom he found such nice little men, and whose society
was so agreeable that he lingered among them, as he thought, for a few
minutes.</p>

He was absent from the neighbourhood for a long period, and the

night to gaze on the starry sky, as he was accustomed (astrology being
one of his favourite studies), and whilst thus occupied the Fairies,

(collar) a very wild and unmanageable horse; and in order to be sure
not to lose his hold of the animal, the man tied the end of the collar
round the middle. So both man and horse went together and got lost.
After much searching the horse was found without the collar, but
nothing was heard of the man. After giving up searching for him as
hopeless, they at last consulted a &ldquo;Dyn Hysbys,&rdquo; (a
conjuror or a wise man). The wise man directed them to go on a certain
night into a field known as Cae Cefn Pantydwr, about forty yards from
the road where the Fairies could be seen dancing, and the lost man
among them, with the &ldquo;penwast&rdquo; still around his waist,
which would enable them to know him; and the way to get him out of the
Fairy Ring was to watch him coming round in the dance, and take hold of
the collar when an opportunity offered itself, and drag the man out
boldly. They did so, and the man was rescued. Ever since then people
dreaded going to that field after dark, especially children.</p>
<p class="par">In some parts of Carmarthenshire, Fairy Rings are known
as &ldquo;Rings y Gwr Drwg&rdquo; (the rings of the Old Gentleman),

<h3 class="main">SON OF LLECH Y DERWYDD AND THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The writer of the following tale was the late Rev.
Benjamin Williams (Gwynionydd), an eminent antiquarian, Folk-Lorist,
and a bard, and it is to be found in Welsh in Y Brython, vol. III.,
page 460. It is evident that the scene of the story was West or
Mid-Wales. Mr. Williams heard the tale from old people who believed in
the truth of it:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy" class="par">&ldquo;Yr oedd mab Llech y Derwydd yn unig
blentyn ei rieni, ac hefyd yn etifedd y tyddyn. Yr oedd felly yn anwyl,
ie, yn ddau lygad ei dad a&rsquo;i fam.</p>
<p lang="cy" class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3391" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Yr oedd y pen gwas a mab y ty yn
gyfeillion mynwesol iawn, fel dau frawd, ie, fel gyfeilliaid. Gan fod y
mab a&rsquo;r gwas y fath gyfeillion, byddai gwraig y ty bob amser yn
darpar dillad i&rsquo;r gwas yr un peth yn hollol ag i&rsquo;r mab.
Cwympodd y ddau gyfaill mewn serch a dwy ddynes ieuainc, brydferth, ac
uchel eu parch yn yr ardal, a mawr oedd y boddineb yn Llech y Derwydd;
ac yn fuan ymunodd y ddau bar mewn glan briodas, a mawr fu y rhialtwch
ar yr amser. Cafodd y gwas le cyfleus i fyw ar dir Llech y Derwydd. Yn
mhen tua haner blwyddyn ar ol priodi o&rsquo;r mab, aeth ei gyfaill ac
yntau allan i hela; enciliodd y deiliad i ryw gilfach lawn o anialwch,
i edrych am helwriaeth; a dychwelodd yn y man at ei gyfaill, ond erbyn
dyfod yno, nid oedd modd gweled y mab yn un man. Parhaodd i edrych o
gwmpas am dro gan waeddi a chwibanu, ond dim un arwydd am ei gyfaill.
Yn mhen tro aeth adref i <span class="corr" id="xd24e3394" title=
"Source: Lech">Llech</span> y Derwydd, gan ddysgwyl ei weled yno; ond
ni wyddai neb ddim am dano. Mawr oedd y gofid yn y teulu drwy y nos; ac
erbyn dranoeth yr oedd eu pryder yn llawer mwy. Aethpwyd i weled y fan
lle y gwelodd ei gyfaill ef olaf. Wylai ei fam a&rsquo;i wraig am y
gwaethaf. Yr oedd y tad dipyn yn well na&rsquo;i wraig a&rsquo;i fam,
ond edrychai yntau fel yn haner gwallgof. Edrychwyd ar y fan olaf y
gwelodd y deiliad ef, ac er eu mawr syndod a&rsquo;u gofid,
canfyddasent gylch y Tylwyth Teg gerllaw y fan, a chofiodd y deiliad yn
y man iddo glywed swn peroriaeth hudoliaethus iawn rywle ar y pryd.
Penderfynwyd ar unwaith iddo fod mor anffodus a myned i gylch y
Tylwyth, a chael ei gludo ymaith na wyddid i ba le.</p>
<p lang="cy" class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3398" title=

a ganwyd mab i fab Llech y Derwydd; ond nid oedd y tad ieuanc yno i
gael gweled ei blentyn, ac yr oedd hyny yn ofidus iawn gan yr hen bobl.
Beth bynag, daeth y dyn bach i fyny yr un ddelw a&rsquo;i dad, fel pe
buasai wedi ei arlunio; a mawr ydoedd yng ngolwg ei daid a&rsquo;i
nain. Efe oedd pobpeth yno. Tyfodd i oedran gwr, a phriododd

gair da i&rsquo;r tylwyth eu bod yn bobl hawddgar.</p>
<p lang="cy" class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3404" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Bu farw yr hen bobl, a bu farw y
ferch-yng-nghyfraith hefyd. Ar ryw brydnawn gwyntog, ym mis Hydref,
gwelai teulu Llech y Derwydd henafgwr tal, teneu, a&rsquo;i farf
a&rsquo;i wallt fel yr eira, yr hwn a dybient ydoedd Iddew, yn dynesu
yn araf araf at y ty. Hylldremiai y morwynion drwy y ffenestr, a
chwarddai y feistress am ben yr &lsquo;hen Iddew,&rsquo; gan godi y
plant un ar ol y llall i&rsquo;w weled yn dyfod. Daeth at y drws, a
daeth i mewn hefyd yn lled eofn, gan ofyn am ei rieni. Atebai y wraig
ef yn daeog, a choeglyd anghyffredin, gan ddywedyd, &lsquo;Beth oedd yr
hen Iddew meddw yn dyfod yno,&rsquo; oblegid tybient ei fod wedi yfed,
onid e ni fuasai yn siarad felly. Edrychai yr hen wr yn syn a phryderus
iawn ar bob peth yn y ty, gan synu llawer; ond ar y plant bychain ar
hyd y llawr y sylwai fwyaf. Edrychai yn llawn siomedigaeth a gofid.
Dywedodd yr hanes i gyd, iddo fod allan yn hela ddoe, a&rsquo;i fod yn
awr yn dychwelyd. Dywedodd y wraig iddi glywed chwedl am dad ei gwr
flynyddau cyn ei geni, ei fod wedi myned ar goll wrth hela; ond fod ei
thad yn dywedyd wrthi nad gwir hyny, mai ei ladd a gafodd. Aeth y wraig
yn anystywallt, ac yn llwyr o&rsquo;i chof eisiau fod yr hen
&lsquo;Iddew&rsquo; yn myned allan. Cyffrodd yr hen wr, a dywedai mai
efe ydoedd perchen y ty, ac y byddai raid iddo gael ei hawl. Aeth allan
i weled ei feddianau, ac yn fuan i dy y deiliad. Er ei syndod, yr oedd
pethau wedi newid yn fawr yno. Ar ol ymddiddan am dro a hen wr oedranus
wrth y tan, edrychai y naill fwy fwy ar y llall. Dywedai yr hen wr beth
fu tynged ei ben gyfaill, mab Llech y Derwydd. Siaradent yn bwyllog am
bethau mebyd, ond yr oedd y cyfan fel breuddwyd. Beth bynag,
penderfynodd yr hen wr yn y cornel mai ei hen gyfaill, mab Llech y
Derwydd, oedd yr ymwelydd, wedi dychwelyd o wlad y Tylwyth Teg, ar ol
bod yno haner can&rsquo; mlynedd. Credodd yr hen wr a&rsquo;r farf wen
ei dynged, a mawr y siarad a&rsquo;r holi fu gan y naill y llall am
oriau lawer.</p>
<p lang="cy" class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3408" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Dywedai fod gwr Llech y Derwydd y diwrnod
hwnw oddi cartref. Cafwyd gan yr hen ymwelydd fwyta bwyd; ond er mawr
fraw, syrthiodd y bwytawr yn farw yn y fan. Nid oes hanes fod
trengholiad wedi bod ar y corff; ond dywedai y chwedl mae yr achos
oedd, iddo fwyta bwyd ar ol bod yn myd y Tylwyth Teg cyhyd. Mynodd ei
hen gyfaill weled ei gladdu yn ochr ei deidiau. Bu melldith fyth, hyd y

"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The above tale translated into English reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The son of Llech y Derwydd was the only child of
his parents, and also the heir to the farm. He was, therefore, very
dear to his father and mother, yea, he was as the very light of their
eyes. The son and the head servant man were more than bosom friends,
they were like two brothers, or rather twins. As the son and the
servant were such close friends, the farmer&rsquo;s wife was in the
habit of clothing them exactly alike. The two friends fell in love with
two young handsome women who were highly respected in the
neighbourhood. This event gave the old people great satisfaction, and
ere long the two couples were joined in holy wedlock, and great was the
merry-making on the occasion. The servant man obtained a <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e3416" title="Source: covenient">convenient</span> place
to live in on the grounds of Llech y Derwydd.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3420" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>About six months after the marriage of
the son, he and the servant man went out to hunt. The servant
penetrated to a ravine filled with brushwood to look for game, and
presently returned to his friend, but by the time he came back the son
was nowhere to be seen. He continued awhile looking about for his
absent friend, shouting and whistling to attract his attention, but
there was no answer to his calls. By and by he went home to Llech y
Derwydd, expecting to find him there, but no one knew anything about
him. Great was the grief of the family throughout the night, but it was
even greater next day. They went to inspect the place where the son had
last been seen. His mother and his wife wept bitterly, but the father
had greater control over himself, still he appeared as half mad. They
inspected the place where the servant man had last seen his friend,
and, to their great surprise and sorrow, observed a Fairy ring close by
the spot, and the servant recollected that he had heard seductive music
somewhere about the time that he parted with his friend.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3424" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>They came to the conclusion at once that
the man had been so unfortunate as to enter the Fairy ring, and they
conjectured that he had been transported no one knew where. Weary weeks
and months passed away, and a son was born to the absent man.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3429" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The little one grew up the very image of
his father, and very precious was he to his grandfather and
grandmother. In fact, he was everything to them. He grew up to
man&rsquo;s estate and married a pretty girl in the neighbourhood, but
her people had not the reputation of being kind-hearted. The old folks
died, and also their daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3433" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>One windy afternoon in the month of
October, the family of Llech y Derwydd saw a tall thin old man with
beard and hair as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span>white as snow, who they thought was a Jew
approaching slowly, very slowly, towards the house. The servant girls
stared mockingly through the window at him, and their mistress laughed
unfeelingly at the &lsquo;old Jew,&rsquo; and lifted the children up,
one after the other, to get a sight of him as he neared the house.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3439" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>He came to the door, and entered the
house boldly enough, and inquired after his parents. The mistress
answered him in a surly and unusually contemptuous manner and wished to
know &lsquo;What the drunken old Jew wanted there,&rsquo; for they
thought he must have been drinking or he would never have spoken in the
way he did. The old man looked at everything in the house with surprise
and bewilderment, but the little children about the floor took his
attention more than anything else. His looks betrayed sorrow and deep
disappointment. He related his whole history, that yesterday he had
gone out to hunt, and that now he had returned. The mistress told him
that she had heard a story about her husband&rsquo;s father, which
occurred before she was born, that he had been lost whilst hunting, but
that her father had told her that the story was not true, but that he
had been killed. The woman became uneasy and angry that the old
&lsquo;Jew&rsquo; did not depart. The old man was roused, and said that
the house was his, and that he would have his rights. He went to
inspect his possessions, and shortly afterwards directed his steps to
the servant&rsquo;s house. To his surprise he saw that things were
greatly changed. After conversing awhile with an aged man who sat by
the fire, they carefully looked each other in the face, and the old man
by the fire related the sad history of his lost friend, the son of
Llech y Derwydd.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3443" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>They conversed together deliberately on
the events of their youth, but all seemed like a dream. However, the
old man in the corner came to the conclusion that his visitor was his
old friend, the son of Llech y Derwydd, returned from the land of the
Fairies, after spending there fifty years.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e3447" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The old man with the white beard believed
the story related by his friend, and long was the talk and many were
the questions which the one gave to the other. The visitor was informed
that the master of Llech y Derwydd was from home that day, and he was
persuaded to eat some food; but to the horror of all, when he had done
so, he instantly fell down dead. We are not informed that an inquest
was held over the body; but the tale relates that the cause of the
man&rsquo;s sudden death was that he ate food after having been so long
in the land of the Fairies. His old friend insisted on the dead man
being buried with his ancestors. The rudeness of the mistress of Llech
y Derwydd to her father-in-law <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>brought a curse upon the
place and family, &lsquo;<span lang="cy">hyd y silcyn
ach</span>,&rsquo; and her offence was not expiated until the farm had
been sold nine times.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">TAFFY AP SION OF PENCADER AMONG THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following Fairy Legend appeared in
&ldquo;British Goblins,&rdquo; page 75<a id="xd24e3460" name=
"xd24e3460"></a>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Taffy ap Sion, the shoemaker&rsquo;s son, living near
Pencader, Carmarthenshire, was a lad who many years ago entered the
Fairy circle on the mountain hard by there, and having danced a few
minutes as he supposed, chanced to step out. He was then astonished to
find that the scene which had been so familiar was now quite strange to
him. Here were roads and houses he had never seen, and in place of his
father&rsquo;s humble cottage there now stood a fine stone farmhouse.
About him were lovely cultivated fields instead of the barren mountain
he was accustomed to.</p>
<p class="par">&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;this is some Fairy
trick to deceive my eyes. It is not ten minutes since I stepped into
that circle, and now when I step out they have built my father a new
house! Well, I only hope it is real; anyhow, I&rsquo;ll go and
see.&rsquo; So he started off by a path he knew instinctively, and
suddenly struck against a very solid hedge. He rubbed his eyes, felt
the hedge with his fingers, scratched his head, felt the hedge again,
ran a thorn into his fingers and cried out, &lsquo;Wbwb&rsquo; this is
no Fairy hedge anyhow, nor, from the age of the thorns, was it grown in
a few minutes&rsquo; time! So he climbed over it and walked on.
&lsquo;Here was I born,&rsquo; said he, as he entered the farmyard,
staring wildly about him, &lsquo;and not a thing here do I know!&rsquo;
His mystification was complete, when there came bounding towards him a
huge dog, barking furiously. &lsquo;What dog is this? Get out you ugly
brute! Don&rsquo;t you know I&rsquo;m master here?&mdash;at least, when
mother&rsquo;s from home, for father don&rsquo;t count.&rsquo; But the
dog only barked the harder. &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; muttered Taffy to
himself, &lsquo;I have lost my road and am wandering through some
unknown neighbourhood; but no, yonder is the Careg Hir!&rsquo; and he
stood staring at the well-known erect stone thus called, which still
stands on the mountain south of Pencader, and is supposed to have been
placed there in ancient times to commemorate a victory. As Taffy stood
thus, looking at the long stone, he heard footsteps behind him, and
turning, beheld the occupant of the farmhouse, who had come out to see
why his dog was barking.</p>
<p class="par">Poor Taffy was so ragged and wan that the farmer&rsquo;s
Welsh heart was at once stirred to sympathy. &lsquo;Who are you, poor
man?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>he asked, to which Taffy answered, &lsquo;I know
who I was, but I do not know who I am now. I was the son of a shoemaker
who lived in this place, this morning; for that rock, though it is
changed a little, I know too well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Poor fellow,&rsquo;
said the farmer, &lsquo;You have lost your senses. This house was built
by my great-grandfather, repaired by my grandfather; and that part
there, which seems newly built, was done about three years ago at my
expense. You must be deranged, or you have missed the road; but come in
and refresh yourself with some victuals, and rest.&rsquo; Taffy was
half persuaded that he had overslept himself and lost his road, but
looking back he saw the rock before mentioned, and exclaimed, &lsquo;It
is but an hour since I was on yonder rock robbing a hawk&rsquo;s
nest.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where have you been since?&rsquo; Taffy related his
adventure. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; quoth the farmer, &lsquo;I see how it
is&mdash;you have been with the Fairies. Pray who was your
father?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sion Evan y Crydd o Glanrhyd,&rsquo; was the
answer. &lsquo;I never heard of such a man,&rsquo; said the farmer,
shaking his head, &lsquo;nor of such a place as Glanrhyd, either; but
no matter<span class="corr" id="xd24e3470" title=
"Not in source">,</span> after you have taken a little food we will
step down to Catti Shon, at Pencader, who will probably be able to tell
something.&rsquo; With this he beckoned Taffy to follow him, and walked
on; but hearing behind him the sound of footsteps growing weaker and
weaker, he turned round, when to his horror he beheld the poor fellow
crumble in an instant to about a thimbleful of black ashes. The farmer,
though much terrified at this sight, preserved his calmness
sufficiently to go at once and see old Catti, the aged crone he had
referred to, who lived at Pencader, near by. He found her crouching
over a fire of faggots, trying to warm her old bones. <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e3473" title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>And how do
you do the day, Catti Shon?&rsquo; asked the farmer. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo;
said old Catti, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m wonderful well, farmer, considering
how old I am.&rsquo; <span class="corr" id="xd24e3476" title=
"Not in source">&lsquo;</span>Yes, yes, you are very old. Now, since
you are so old, let me ask you&mdash;do you remember anything about
Sion y Crydd o Glanrhyd? Was there ever such a man, do you know?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sion Glanrhyd?<a id="xd24e3479" name="xd24e3479"></a> O! I have
a faint recollection of hearing my grandfather, old Evan Shenkin,
Penferdir, relate that Sion&rsquo;s son was lost one morning, and they
never heard of him afterwards, so that it was said he was taken by the
Fairies. His father&rsquo;s cottage stood somewhere near your
house.&rsquo; &lsquo;Were there many Fairies about at that time?&rsquo;
asked the farmer<span class="corr" id="xd24e3482" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> &lsquo;O, yes; they were often seen on yonder
hill, and I was told they were lately seen in Pant Shon Shenkin, eating
flummery out of egg-shells, which they had stolen from a farm hard
by.&rsquo; &lsquo;<span lang="cy">Dir anwyl fi!</span>&rsquo; cried the

<h3 class="main">SHON AP SHENKIN SEDUCED BY FAIRY MUSIC.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Another story very similar to the one I have just
given is the legend of Shon ap Shenkin, which was related to Mr. Sikes
by a farmer&rsquo;s wife near the reputed scene of the tale, that is
the locality of Pant Shon Shenkin, the famous centre of Carmarthenshire
Fairies:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shon ap Shenkin was a young man who lived hard by
Pant Shon Shenkin. As he was going afield early one fine summer&rsquo;s
morning he heard a little bird singing, in a most enchanting strain, on
a tree close by his path. Allured by the melody, he sat down under the
tree until the music ceased, when he arose and looked about him. What
was his surprise at observing that the tree, which was green and full
of life when he sat down, was now withered and barkless! Filled with
astonishment he returned to the farmhouse which he had left, as he
supposed, a few minutes<a id="xd24e3500" name="xd24e3500"></a> before;
but it also was changed, grown older, and covered with ivy. In the
doorway stood an old man whom he had never before seen; he at once
asked the old man what he wanted there. &lsquo;What do I want
here?&rsquo; ejaculated the old man, reddening angrily;
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s a pretty question! Who are you that dare to insult
me in my own house?&rsquo; &lsquo;In your own house? How is this?
where&rsquo;s my father and mother, whom I left here a few minutes
since, whilst I have been listening to the charming music under yon
tree, which, when I rose, was withered and leafless&rsquo; &lsquo;Under
the tree!&mdash;music!<span class="corr" id="xd24e3502" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your
name<span class="corr" id="xd24e3505" title=
"Not in source">?</span>&rsquo; <span class="corr" id="xd24e3508"
title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>Shon ap Shenkin.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Alas, poor Shon, and this is indeed you!&rsquo; cried the old
man. &lsquo;I often heard my grandfather, your father, speak of you,
and long did he bewail your absence. Fruitless inquiries were made for
you; but old Catti Maddock of Brechfa said you were under the power of
the Fairies, and would not be released until the last sap of that
sycamore tree would be dried. Embrace me, my dear uncle, for you are my
uncle ... embrace your nephew.&rsquo; With this the old man extended
his arms, but before the two men could embrace, poor Shon ap Shenkin
crumbled into dust on the door-step.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is very interesting to compare this story of Shon ap
Shenkin, under the power of the Fairies, listening to the birds of
enchantment, with the warriors at Harlech listening to the Birds of
Rhiannon, in the Mabinogi of Branwen, daughter of Llyr.</p>
<p class="par">Bran Fendigaid, a Welsh King in ancient times, had a
palace at Harlech, and had a sister named Bronwen, or White Breast,
whom Matholwch the King of Ireland married on account of her wonderful
beauty. After a while, however, the foster brothers of Matholwch
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>began to treat Bronwen very cruelly till at last
she found means to send a message to her brother Bran, in Wales; and
this she did by writing a letter of her woes, which she bound to a
bird&rsquo;s wing which she had reared. The bird reached
Bronwen&rsquo;s brother, Bran, who, when he read the letter sailed for
Ireland immediately, and during a fearful warfare in that country he
was poisoned with a dart in his foot. His men had been bidden by their
dying chief to cut off his head and bear it to London and bury it with
the face towards France. They did as they were bidden by Bran previous
to his death, and various were the adventures they encountered while
obeying this injunction. At Harlech they stopped to rest, and sat down
to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="par">While there, they heard three birds singing a sweet
song, &ldquo;at a great distance over the sea,&rdquo; though it seemed
to them as though they were quite near. These were the birds of
Rhiannon. Their notes were so sweet that warriors were known to have
remained spell-bound for 80 years listening to them. The birds sang so
sweetly that the men rested for seven years, which appeared but a day.
Then they pursued their way to Gwales in Pembrokeshire, and there
remained for four score years, during which the head of Bran was
uncorrupted. At last they went to London and buried it there.</p>
<p class="par">The old Welsh poets often allude to the birds of
Rhiannon, and they are also mentioned in the Triads; and the same
enchanting fancy reappears in the local story of Shon ap Shenkin, which
I just gave.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Ernest Rhys in the present day sings:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;O, the birds of Rhiannon they sing time
away,&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Seven years in their singing are gone like a
day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In the region of myth and romance Rhiannon, the
songs of whose birds were so enchanting, was the daughter of Heveydd
Hen, who by her magic arts foiled her powerful suitor, Gwawl ap Clud,
and secured as her consort the man of her choice, Pwyll, Prince of
Dyfed. In Welsh Mythology several members of the kingly families are
represented as playing the role of magicians.</p>
<p class="par">It may be added that it is interesting to compare both
the story of Shion ap Shenkin, and that of the birds of Rhiannon, with
Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Legend,&rdquo; originally written in
the thirteenth century by Jacobus de Voragine, in which Monk Felix is
represented as listening to the singing of a snow-white bird for a

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Shui was a beautiful girl of seventeen,
tall and fair, with a skin like ivory, hair black and curling, and eyes
of dark velvet. She was but a poor farmer&rsquo;s daughter,
notwithstanding her beauty, and among her duties was that of driving up
the cows for the milking. Over this work she used to loiter sadly, to
pick flowers by the way, or chase the butterflies, or amuse herself in
any agreeable manner that fortune offered. For her loitering she was
often chided, indeed, people said Shui&rsquo;s mother was far too sharp
with the girl, and that it was for no good the mother had so bitter a
tongue. After all the girl meant no harm, they said. But when one night
Shui never came home till bed-time, leaving the cows to care for
themselves, dame Rhys took the girl to task as she never had done
before. &lsquo;<span lang="cy">Ysgwaetheroedd, Mami</span>,&rsquo; said
Shui, &lsquo;I could not help it; it was the <span lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</span>,&rsquo; (the Fairies). The dame was aghast at this, but she
could not answer it&mdash;for well she knew the Tylwyth Teg were often
seen in the woods of Cardigan. Shui was at first shy about talking of
the Fairies, but finally confessed they were little men in green coats,
who danced around her and made music on their little harps; and they
talked to her in language too beautiful to be repeated; indeed she
couldn&rsquo;t understand the words, though she knew well enough what
the Fairies meant. Many a time after that Shui was late; but now nobody
chided her, for fear of offending the Fairies. At last one night
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=

woods were searched; there was no sign of her; and never was she seen
in Cardigan again. Her mother watched in the fields on the <span lang=
"cy">Tair-nos ysprydion</span> or three nights of the year when goblins
are sure to be abroad; but Shui never returned. Once indeed there came
to the neighbourhood a wild rumour that Shui Rhys had been seen in a
great city in a foreign land&mdash;Paris, perhaps, or London, who
knows? but this tale was in no way injurious to the sad belief that the
Fairies had carried her off; they might take her to those well-known
centres of idle and sinful pleasure, as well as to any other
place.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd24e3849src" href="#xd24e3849"

(Cardiganshire), about that time, confirmed by divers persons of good
quality and reputation the substance of whereof are as followeth. A man
and his family being all in bed, he being awake about midnight,
perceived by a light entering the little room where he lay, and about a
dozen in the shapes of men, and two or three women with small children
in their arms following, they seemed to dance, and the chamber appeared
much wider and lighter than formerly. They seemed to eat bread and
cheese all about a kind of a tick upon the ground, they offered him
some, and would smile upon him, he heard no voice, but calling once
upon God to bless him, he heard a whispering voice in Welsh bidding him
hold his peace. They continued there about four hours, all which time
he endeavoured to wake his wife but could not. Afterwards they went
into another room, and having danced awhile departed. He then arose,
and though the room was very small, yet he could neither find the door,
nor the way to bed again until crying out his wife and family
awoke.</p>

Llanddeiniol, about six miles from Aberystwyth, informed me that many
years ago, when he was a young man, or a lad of 18, he was engaged as a
servant at a farm called Perthrhys, in that neighbourhood. One evening
after supper he went to the tailor who was making him a suit of
clothes; but as the clothes were not quite ready he had to wait till a
late hour before returning home, but it was a delightful moonlight
night. As he proceeded along a lonely path across a certain moor known
as Rhosrhydd, and happened to look back he was suddenly surprised by
seeing two young men or boys as he thought, coming after him. At first
he thought they were some boys trying to frighten him; but after they
had followed him for a short distance till they came within about 30 or
40 yards of him, they turned out from the path, and began to jump and
to dance, going round and round as if they followed a ring or a circle
just as we hear of the fairies. They were perfectly white, and very
nimble, and the old man informed me that there was something
supernatural both in their appearance and movements; and that he is
convinced to this day that they could not have been human beings. When
he arrived home at the farm, and related his adventure, every one in
the house was of the opinion that the strange beings he had seen were

watching the movements of the Fairies, Nancy remarked, &ldquo;That

<h3 class="main">THE CARDIGANSHIRE PAINTER AND MUSICIAN, WHO PLAYED HIS
FLUTE TO THE FAIRY LADIES AND NEARLY SECURED ONE OF THEM AS A
WIFE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">About the year 1860, a builder from Aberayron, in
Cardiganshire, was erecting a Vicarage at Nantcwnlle, about nine miles
from Aberayron, not far from Llangeitho. There was a certain man there
employed as a painter, whose name was John Davies, a harmless and
superstitious character, who once had been an exciseman, afterwards a
carpenter, and at last became a painter, though he did not shine in
either of the two trades. He was however, a brilliant musician, and
belonged to a musical family. He was acquainted with the works of
Handel, Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, whilst one of his favourites was
the song of the Witches in &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; He also always
carried his flute in his pocket. Whilst this Nantcwnlle Vicarage was in
course of construction, John was sent one day on a message to
Aberayron. He went there in due time, and in the afternoon left the
town and started on his return journey, having the choice of two
roads&mdash;either returning through the Vale of Aeron, or across the
hill&mdash;country of Cilcennin, The latter was a very lonely route,
but he chose it as it was about two miles shorter. So John hurried on
his journey so as to reach his destination before night. When he came
to the little village of Cilcennin, he had a good mind to enter the
public house known as the &ldquo;Commercial,&rdquo; to see his old
friend Llywelyn, when he remembered that it was getting late and that
he had to pass by the ghosts of the moors and the Fairy circles on the
top of the mountain. After walking on again about a mile, he arrived at
another public house, known as &ldquo;Rhiwlas Arms.&rdquo; He was now
within three miles to the end of his journey, and it occurred to him
that it would be a splendid thing to have one pint of beer to give him
strength and courage to meet the ghosts. So in he went into the Public
House, where he met with many old friends, and drank more than one
pint. After taking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>out his flute from his pocket, John obliged
the merry company with many of the old Welsh airs, such as &ldquo;Ar
Hyd y Nos,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glan Meddwdod Mwyn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Llwyn
on,&rdquo; etc. It was 8 o&rsquo;clock p.m., and in the middle of
October. John started from the house, boasting to those who were
present that he was not afraid, but poor fellow, as soon as he went out
into the darkness and the stillness of the night, his heart began to
beat very fast. Nevertheless, he walked forward from the cross-road
towards Hendraws, and turned to a road which led direct to Nantcwnlle.
For a considerable distance, there was no hedge except on one side of
the road, and nothing but a vast open moor on the other side. John knew
that he was to pass a small cottage called Ty-clottas, and expected
every moment to see the light of the old woman who lived there, who was
known as Peggi Ty-clottas. Unfortunately, John had somehow or other
wandered away from the road into the bog; but seeing light before him,
he went on confidently. He followed the light for some distance, but
did not come to any house, and he noticed that the light was travelling
and giving a little jump now and again.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At the early dawn next morning, old <span class="corr"
id="xd24e3898" title="Source: Peggie">Peggi</span> Ty-clottas, when she
was half awake, heard some strange music, more strange than she had
ever heard before. At first she thought it was the &ldquo;toili&rdquo;
(phantom funeral), which had come to warn her of her approaching death;
for to believe in the &ldquo;toili&rdquo; was part of Peggi&rsquo;s
confession of faith. But when she listened attentively, Peggi found out
that the music was not a dead march, but rather something light and
merry. So it could not have been the &ldquo;toili.&rdquo; Afterwards
she thought it was the warbling of some bird. <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e3901" title="Source: Peggie">Peggi</span> had heard the lark many
a time at the break of day singing songs of praises to the Creator. She
had also heard the lapwing and other birds, breaking on the loneliness
of her solitary home; but never had she heard a bird like this one
singing, singing continually without a pause. At last she got up from
her bed and went out into the moor in order to see what was there. To
her great surprise, she saw a man sitting on a heap, and blowing into
some instrument, who took no notice of Peggi. Peggi went quite close to
the man and asked him in a loud voice, &ldquo;What do you want
here?&rdquo; Then the man stirred up and ceased to blow, and with an
angry look, said,&mdash;&ldquo;Ah you,&mdash;you have spoiled
everything; it nearly came to a bargain.&rdquo; It proved that the man
whom Peggi came upon was John Davies, the painter, who had been playing
his flute to the Fairies, and had almost made a bargain with them to
marry a Fairy lady, when old Peggi came to spoil everything.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=

<p class="par">When Mr. T. Compton Davies, heard about John among the
Fairies he went to him and begged him to tell him all about it; and he
did so. According to John&rsquo;s own account of his night adventure it
was something as follows:&mdash;When he got lost in the bog, he
followed the light, till presently, he came to a Fairy ring, where a
large number of little Fairy ladies danced in it, and to his great
surprise, one of them took his arm, so that John also began to dance.
And after a while, the Queen of the Fairies herself came on to him, and
asked him, &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; John replied,
&ldquo;From the world of mortals,&rdquo; and added that he was a
painter. Then she said to him, that they had no need of a painter in
the world of Fairies, as there was nothing getting old there. John
found the Fairies all ladies, or at least he did not mention any men.
They were very beautiful, but small, and wearing short white dresses
coming down to the knees only. When he took out from his pocket his
flute and entertained them by playing some Irish, Scotch, and English
airs, the Queen informed him that they (the Fairies) were of Welsh
descent. Then John played some Welsh airs from Owen Alaw to the great
delight of the Fairy ladies, and they had a merry time of it. John soon
became a great favourite, and asked for something to drink, but found
they were &ldquo;teetotals.&rdquo; Then he fell in love with one of the
Fairy ladies, and asked the Queen for the hand of the maiden, and
informed her that he had a horse named Bob, as well as a cart of his
own making. The Queen in reply said that they were not accustomed to
mix with mortals, but as he had proved himself such a musician, she
gave her consent under the conditions that he and the little lady
should come once a month on the full moon night to the top of Mount
Trichrug to visit the Fairies. Then the Queen took hold of a pot full
of gold which she intended giving John as a dowry, but, unfortunately,
at the very last moment, when he was just going to take hold of it, old
Peggi TyClottas came to shout and to spoil the whole thing; for as soon
as the Fairy ladies saw old Peggi, they all vanished through some steps
into the underground regions and John never saw them again. But he
continued to believe as long as he lived that he had been with the
Fairies.</p>

"pb128">128</a>]</span>Lion, lives at Aberayron, and the other Evan
Lewis is a farmer near Mydroilyn, in the parish of Llanarth. I went to
see both of them, and they gave me a full account of what they had seen
which was something as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">In August, 1862, David Evans<a id="xd24e3918" name=
"xd24e3918"></a> and Evan Lewis, went from the Coast of Cardiganshire
with their waggons all the way to Brecon for some timber for
ship-building, which was going on at New Quay. On their return journey,
through Carmarthenshire, they stopped for a short time at a place
called Cwmdwr on the road leading from Llanwrda to Lampeter. It was
about 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and the two men and their
horses and waggons were standing opposite a farm known as Maestwynog,
where the reapers were busy at work in a wheat-field close by. As they
were looking in the direction of a hillside not far off, David Evans
saw about fifty small wheat stacks (<span lang="cy">sopynau
bychain</span>), as he at first thought. On second sight, however, he
noticed that they were moving about, he took them for reapers. They
were all dressed exactly alike, and walked fast one after another up
the hillside footpath. David Evans now called the attention of his
companion Evan Lewis, whom he asked who the men could have been; but
before he had time to make any further remarks, the first of those who
were climbing up along the winding footpath had reached a small level
spot on the top of the hill. The others quickly followed him, and each
one in coming to the top, gave a jump to dance, and they formed a
circle. After dancing for a short time, one of the dancers turned in
into the middle of the circle, followed by the others, one by one till
they appeared like a gimblet screw. Then they disappeared into the
ground. After awhile one of them reappeared again, and looked about him
in every direction as a rat, and the others followed him one by one and
did the same. Then they danced for some time as before, and vanished
into the ground as they had done the first time. The two men, David
Evans and Evan Lewis were watching them from a distance of about 400
yards and were more than astonished to see men, as they thought, acting
in such a strange and curious manner on the hill. They continued
looking for some time but the dancers did not appear again. At last the
two men proceeded on their journey till they came to an old man working
on the road whom they asked whether he knew anything about the men they
had seen dancing in a circle on the hill behind Maestwynog. The old man
replied that he had not the least idea, but had heard his grandfather
say that the Tylwyth Teg (Fairies) used to dance in his time, at which
explanation our two friends smiled. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the above account we see that the hill near
Maestwynog was a special haunt of the Fairies, even in modern days.
There are certain spots here and there all over Wales, pointed out by
old people to this day, as having been frequented in former times by
the Fairies to dance and to sing. An old man named James Jones, Golden
Lion, Llanarth, informed me that when a boy he heard from the lips of
old men, many a tale of Fairies seen on Bank-rhydeiniol; and that they
were mounted on horses, riding and playing; and the late Rev. J.
Davies, Moria, mentions that there were traditions of them appearing on
Bannau Duon in the same parish. In the northern part of Cardiganshire,
the people of Talybont showed me a spot a few miles to the east of that
village, where these supernatural beings appeared long ago, more
especially to dance. The neighbourhood of Aberporth, in the southern
part of the same county, was also a favourite spot according to an old
woman in the village. Pant Shon Shenkin in the neighbourhood of
Pencader was a famous place for Carmarthenshire Fairies, of which
district we have already given the reader more than one story.</p>
<p class="par">Gwynionydd in the Brython for 1860, remarks that in
former times the Fairies were fond of the mountains of <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e3928" title="Source: Dyved">Dyfed</span>, and that
travellers in Cardiganshire, between Lampeter and the town of Cardigan
often saw them on Llanwenog hill; but after arriving on that spot they
would be seen far away on the mountains of Llandyssul, and expecting to
find them there, they would be seen somewhere else, both deluding and
eluding the traveller.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE FAIRIES OF CWM MABWS, SEEN DRIVING IN THEIR
CARRIAGES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the interesting small valley of Cwm Mabws, near
Llanrhystyd, nine miles from Aberystwyth, there is a rocky spot known
as Craig Rhydderch. Even within the memory of some who are still alive,
the caves of Craig Rhydderch were the favourite haunts of the Fairies,
where these mysterious beings were thought to dwell, or at least pass
through to the underground regions. The Fairies of this part were, it
was supposed, some kind of spirits or supernatural beings, and were
often seen in the Valley of Mabws going about in their phantom
carriages and horses. About fifty years ago when Fairies were still to
be seen in this neighbourhood, the eldest son of Penlan farm, and some
of the men servants one evening just before dark, took their horses
down to the little river which runs through the bottom of the valley in
order to give the animals water, as there was no water near the
farm-house which stood on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>high ground. As they were on their
way to the river they heard some noise on the road quite near them, and
the farmer&rsquo;s son said to the servants, &ldquo;It is the noise of
the Fairies on their journey, and they are coming from the direction of
Craig Rhydderch; let us stand one side of the road to make room for
them to pass.&rdquo; And sure enough, just as he spoke, a number of
Fairies appeared on the scene and passed by as if they were on a
journey. They were little men with little horses and carriages, but my
informant could not tell me the colour of their dresses nor the colour
of their horses</p>
<p class="par">After taking their horses to the water and turning them
into a field, the men went home to Penlan; and as soon as they entered
the house and related what they had seen, another son of the farm had
just arrived home from Aberystwyth with a horse and cart, and he also
had seen the Fairies, just as he was turning to the road which led up
the hill.</p>
<p class="par">The above story was related to me by Mr. David Morgan,
Carpenter, Llanrhystyd, who vouches for the truth of the account as he
was well acquainted with the persons who saw the Fairies, and one of
them was a friend of his.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is a curious tradition that early one Easter
Monday, when the parishioners of Pencarreg and Caio were met to play at
football, they saw a numerous company of Fairies dancing. Being so many
in number, the young men were not intimidated at all, but proceeded in
a body towards the puny tribe, who perceiving them, removed to another
place. The young men followed, whereupon the little folk suddenly
disappeared dancing at the first place. Seeing this, the men divided
and surrounded them, when they immediately became invisible, and were
never more seen there. This was in Carmarthenshire.</p>

Lampeter and Llanarth, in Troed yr Aur, in Cardiganshire.</p>

<h3 class="main">FAIRIES MARKETING.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was formerly believed in some parts of West
Wales, especially by the people dwelling near the sea coast, that the
Fairies visited markets and fairs, and that their presence made
business very brisk. I have already referred to the &ldquo;Gwerddonau
Llion,&rdquo; or the enchanted &ldquo;Isles of the Sea,&rdquo;
inhabited by Fairy Tribes. These Fairies, it was believed, went to and
fro between the islands and shore, through a subterranean gallery under
the bottom of the sea, and regularly attended the markets at Milford
Haven, in Pembrokeshire and Laugharne in Carmarthenshire.
(&ldquo;British <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"
name="pb131">131</a>]</span>Goblins,&rdquo; page 10.) They made their
purchases without speaking, laid down their money and departed, always
leaving the exact sum required, which they seemed to know, without
asking the price of anything. Sometimes they were invisible, but they
were often seen by sharp-eyed persons. There was one special butcher at
Milford Haven upon whom the Fairies bestowed their patronage, instead
of distributing their favours indiscriminately.</p>
<p class="par">According to Gwynionydd in the &ldquo;Brython,&rdquo;
for 1858, page 110, these Fairies also came to market to Cardigan, and
it was thought they raised the prices of things terribly whenever they
came there. In that part of the country they were known as &ldquo;Plant
Rhys Ddwfn.&rdquo; No one saw them coming there or going away, only
seen there in the market. When prices in the market happened to be
high, and the corn all sold, however, much there might have been there
in the morning, the poor used to say to one another on the way home,
&ldquo;Oh! They were there to-day,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Plant Rhys
Ddwfn,&rdquo; or the Fairies. These Fairies were liked by the farmers
who had corn to sell, but disliked by the poor labourers who had to buy
corn and give higher price for it. Gwynionydd also says that: &ldquo;A
certain Gruffydd Ap Einon was wont to sell them more corn than anybody
else, and that he was a great friend of theirs. He was honoured by them
beyond all his contemporaries by being led on a visit to their home. As
they were great traders, like the Ph&oelig;nicians of old, they had
treasures from all countries under the sun. Gruffydd, after feasting
his eyes to satiety on their wonders was led back by them loaded with
presents. But before taking leave of them, he asked them how they
succeeded in keeping themselves safe from invaders, as one of their
number might become unfaithful, and go beyond the virtue of the herbs
that formed their safety. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the little old man
of shrewd looks, &ldquo;Just as Ireland has been blessed with a soil on
which venomous reptiles cannot live, so with our land; no traitor can
live here. Look at the sand on the seashore; perfect unity prevails
there, and so among us.&rdquo; Rhys, the father of our race, bade us
even to the most distant descendant to honour our parents and
ancestors; love our own wives without looking at those of our
neighbours, and do our best for our children and grandchildren. And he
said that if we did so, no one of us would prove unfaithful to another,
or become what you call a traitor. The latter is a wholly imaginary
character among us; strange pictures are drawn of him with his feet
like those of an ass, with a nest of snakes in his bosom, with a head
like the Devil&rsquo;s, with hands somewhat like a man&rsquo;s while
one of them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>holds a large knife and the family dead around
him Good-bye!&rdquo; When Gruffydd looked about him he lost sight of
the country of Plant Rhys, and found himself near his home. He became
very wealthy after this, and continued to be a great friend of Plant
Rhys as long as he lived. After Gruffydd&rsquo;s death they came to the
market again, but such was the greed of the farmers, like Gruffydd
before them, for riches, and so unreasonable were the prices they asked
for their corn, that the Rhysians took offence and came no more to
Cardigan to market. The old people used to think that they now went to
Fishguard market, as very strange people were wont to be seen
there.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. B. Davies in the II. Vol. of the
&ldquo;Brython,&rdquo; page 182, gives the following tale of a Fairy
Changeling in the neighbourhood of Newcastle Emlyn, in the Vale of
Teifi, and on the borders of Carmarthenshire and
Cardiganshire:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;One calm hot day, when the sun of heaven was
brilliantly shining, and the hay in the dales was being busily made by
lads and lasses, and by grown-up people of both sexes, a woman in the
neighbourhood of Emlyn placed her one-year-old infant in the
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">gader</span>&rdquo; or chair, as the cradle is
called in these parts<span class="corr" id="xd24e3971" title=
"Source: ,">,</span> and out she went to the field for a while,
intending to return when her neighbour, an old woman overtaken by the
decrepitude of eighty summers, should call to her that her Darling was
crying. It was not long before she heard the old woman calling to her;
she ran hurriedly, and as soon as she set foot on the kitchen floor,
she took her little one in her arms as usual, saying to him, &ldquo;O
my little one! thy mother&rsquo;s delight art thou! I would not take
the world for thee, etc.&rdquo; But to her surprise, he had a very old
look about him, and the more the tender-hearted mother gazed at his
face, the stranger it seemed to her, so that at last she placed him in
the cradle and told her sorrow to her relatives and acquaintances. And
after this one and the other had given his opinion, it was agreed at
last that it was one of Rhys Ddwfn&rsquo;s children that was in the
cradle, and not her dearly loved baby. In this distress there was
nothing to do but to fetch a wizard, or wise man, as fast as the
fastest horse could gallop. He said, when he saw the child that he had
seen his like before, and that it would be a hard job to get rid of
him, though not such a very hard job this time. The shovel was made red
hot in the fire by one of the Cefnarth (Cenarth) boys, and held before
the child&rsquo;s face; and in an instant the short little old man took
to his heels, and neither he nor his like was seen afterwards from
Abercuch to Aberbargod at any rate. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>mother found her
darling unscathed the next moment. I remember also hearing that the
strange child was as old as the grandfather of the one that had been
lost.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Celtic Folk-Lore&rdquo; by Sir J. Rhys.</p>
<p class="par">There are many such stories in different parts of Wales
and Scotland, and in both countries Fairies were believed to have a
fatal admiration for lovely children, and credited with stealing them,
especially unbaptized infants.</p>
<p class="par">A Welsh poet thus sings:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Llawer plentyn teg aeth ganddynt,</p>

<p class="line">When long and bitter was the pain;</p>
<p class="line">From their parents, loving, dear,</p>
<p class="line">To the Fairies&rsquo; dread domain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Another popular mode of treatment resorted to in
order to reclaim children from the Fairies, and to get rid of ugly
changelings was as follows:&mdash;The mother was to carry the
changeling to a river, and when at the brink, the wizard who
accompanied her was to cry out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="cy" class="line">&ldquo;Crap ar y wrach&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">(A grip on the hag.)</p>

<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="cy" class="line">&ldquo;Rhy hwyr gyfraglach&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">(Too late decrepit one);</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Then the mother was to throw the changeling into
the river, and then returning home, where she would find her own child
safe and sound.</p>

<h3 class="main">HOW TO DETECT CHANGELINGS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One way of finding out whether children were
Changelings or not was to listen to them speaking. If suspected
children were heard speaking things above the understanding of
children, it was considered a proof that they were changelings. This
was a wide-spread belief in Wales.</p>
<p class="par">Fairies did not always come to steal children, however,
for they were believed in some places to enter the houses at night to
dance and sing until the morning, and leave on the hearth-stone a piece
of money as a reward behind them, should they find the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>house clean; but should it be dirty, they came
to punish the servant girl. The good Fairies known as &ldquo;Bendith y
Mamau,&rdquo; were supposed to rock the infant&rsquo;s cradle and sweep
and clean the house whilst the tired mother slept. And one way of
securing their good luck was to leave a little milk for them upon the
kitchen table at night.</p>

<p class="par first">The following story is to be found in Welsh in an
interesting little book entitled &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Ystraeon y
Gwyll</span>,&rdquo; by the late Mr. D. Lledrod Davies; and in English
by Sir John Rhys in his great work &ldquo;Celtic
Folk-Lore&rdquo;:&mdash;The locality of the tale is Swyddffynon, near
Ystrad Meurig, in Cardiganshire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It used to be related by an old woman who died
some thirty years ago at the advanced age of about 100. She was Pali,
mother of old Rachel Evans, who died seven or eight years ago, when she
was about eighty. The latter was a curious character, who sometimes
sang &ldquo;Maswedd,&rdquo; or rhymes of doubtful propriety, and used
to take the children of the village to see fairy rings. She also used
to see the &ldquo;Tylwyth<span class="corr" id="xd24e4043" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (Fairies), and had many tales to tell of
them. But her mother, Pali, had actually been called to attend at the
confinement of one of them. The beginning of the tale is not very
explicit; but, anyhow, Pali one evening found herself face to face with
the Fairy lady she was to attend upon. She appeared to be the wife of
one of the princes of the country. She was held in great esteem, and
lived in a very grand palace. Everything there had been arranged in the
most beautiful and charming fashion. The wife was in her bed with
nothing about her but white, and she fared sumptuously. In due time,
when the baby had been born, the midwife had all the care connected
with dressing it and serving its mother. Pali could see or hear nobody
in the whole place, but the mother and the baby. She had no idea who
attended on them, or who prepared all the things <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>they
required, for it was all done noiselessly and secretly. The mother was
a charming person, of an excellent temper and easy to manage. Morning
and evening, as she finished washing the baby, Pali had a certain
ointment given her to rub the baby with. She was charged not to touch
it, but with her hand, and especially not to put any near her eyes.
This was carried out for some time, but one day, as she was dressing
the baby, her eyes happened to itch, and she rubbed them with her hand.
Then at once she saw a great many wonders she had not before perceived;
and the whole place assumed a new aspect to her. She said nothing, and
in the course of the day she saw a great deal more. Among other things,
she observed small men and small women going in and out following a
variety of occupations. But their movements were as light as the
morning breezes. To move about was no trouble to them, and they brought
things into the room with the greatest quickness. They prepared dainty
food for the confined lady with the utmost order and skill, and the air
of kindness and affection with which they served her was truly
remarkable. In the evening, as she was dressing the baby, the midwife
said to the lady, &ldquo;You have had a great many visitors
to-day.&rdquo; To this she replied, &ldquo;How do you know that? Have
you been putting this ointment to your eyes?&rdquo; Thereupon she
jumped out of bed, and blew into her eyes, saying, &ldquo;Now you will
see no more.&rdquo; She never afterwards could see the fairies, however
much she tried, nor was the ointment entrusted to her after that
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">Knockers were supposed to be a species of Fairies
which haunted the mines, and underground regions, and whose province it
was to indicate by knocks and other sounds, the presence of rich veins
of ore. That miners in former times did really believe in the existence
of such beings is quite evident from the following two letters written
by Lewis Morris (great grandfather of Sir Lewis Morris the poet) in
October 14th, 1754, and December 4th, 1754. They appeared in
Bingley&rsquo;s North Wales, Vol<span class="corr" id="xd24e4076"

<p class="par">&ldquo;People who know very little of arts or sciences,
or the powers of nature (which, in other words are the powers of the
author of nature), will laugh at us Cardiganshire miners, who maintain
the existence of &ldquo;Knockers&rdquo; in mines, a kind of
good-natured impalpable people not to be seen, but heard, and who seem
to us to work in the mines; that is to say, they are the types or
forerunners of working in mines, as dreams are of some accidents, which
happen to us. The barometer falls before rain, or storms. If we do not
know the construction of it, we should call it a kind of dream that
foretells rain; but we know it is natural, and produced by natural
means, comprehended by us. Now, how are we sure, or anybody sure, but
that our dreams are produced by the same natural means? There is some
faint resemblance of this in the sense of hearing; the bird is killed
before we hear the report of the gun. However, this is, I must speak
well of the &ldquo;Knockers,&rdquo; for they have actually stood my
good-friends, whether they are aerial beings called spirits, or whether
they are a people made of matter, not to be felt by our gross bodies,
as air and fire and the like. &ldquo;Before the discovery of the
&ldquo;Esgair y Mwyn&rdquo; mine, these little people, as we call them
here, worked hard there day and night; and there are honest, sober

them or of mines either; but after the <span class="corr" id=

they were heard no more. When I began to work at Llwyn Llwyd, they
worked so fresh there for a considerable time that they frightened some
young workmen out of the work. This was when we were driving levels,
and before we had got any ore; but when we came to the ore, they then
gave over, and I heard no more talk of them. Our old miners are no more
concerned at hearing them &ldquo;blasting,&rdquo; boring holes, landing
&ldquo;deads,&rdquo; etc., than if they were some of their own people;
and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>single miner will stay in the work, in the dead
of night, without any man near him, and never think of any fear of any
harm they will do him. The miners have a notion that the
&ldquo;knockers&rdquo; are of their own tribe and profession, and are a
harmless people who mean well. Three or four miners together shall hear
them sometimes, but if the miners stop to take notice of them, the
&ldquo;knockers&rdquo; will also stop; but, let the miners go on at
their work, suppose it is &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;knockers&rdquo; will at the same time go on as brisk as can be
in landing, &ldquo;blasting.&rdquo; or beating down the
&ldquo;loose,&rdquo; and they are always heard a little distance from
them before they come to the ore.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These are odd assertions, but they are certainly
facts, though we cannot, and do not pretend to account for them. We
have now very good ore at &ldquo;Llwyn Llwyd,&rdquo; where the
&ldquo;knockers&rdquo; were heard to work, but we have now yielded the
place, and are no more heard. Let who will laugh, we have the greatest
reason to rejoice, and thank the &ldquo;knockers,&rdquo; or rather God,
who sends us these notices.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The second letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have no time to answer your objection against
&lsquo;knockers&rsquo;; I have a large treatise collected on that head,
and what Mr. Derham says is nothing to the purpose. If sounds of
voices, whispers, blasts, working, or pumping, can be carried on a mile
underground, they should always be heard in the same place, and under
the same advantages, and not once in a month, a year, or two years.
Just before the discovery of ore last week, three men together in our
work at &ldquo;Llwyn Llwyd&rdquo; were ear-witnesses of
&ldquo;knockers,&rdquo; pumping, driving a wheelbarrow, etc.; but there
is no pump in the work, nor any mine within less than a mile of it, in
which there are pumps constantly going. If they were these pumps that
they heard, why were they never heard but that once in the space of a
year? And why are they not now heard? But the pumps make so little
noise that they cannot be heard in the other end of &ldquo;Esgair y
Mwyn&rdquo; mine when they are at work. We have a dumb and deaf tailor
in the neighbourhood who has a particular language of his own by signs,
and by practice I can understand him and make him understand me pretty
well, and I am sure I could make him learn to write, and be understood
by letters very soon, for he can distinguish men already by the letters
of their names. Now letters are marks to convey ideas, just after the
same manner as the motion of fingers, hands, eyes, etc. If this man had
really seen ore in the bottom of a sink of water in a mine and wanted
to tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>me how to come at it, he would take two sticks
like a pump, and would make the motions of a pumper at the very sink
where he knew the ore was, and would make the motions of driving a
wheelbarrow. And what I should infer from thence would be that I ought
to take out the water and sink or drive in the place, and wheel the
stuff out. By parity of reasoning, the language of
&ldquo;knockers,&rdquo; by imitating the sound of pumping, wheeling,
etc., signifies that we should take out the water and drive there. This
is the opinion of all old miners, who pretend to understand the
language of the &ldquo;knockers.&rdquo; Our agent and manager, upon the
strength of this notice, goes on and expect great things. You, and
everybody that is not convinced of the being of &ldquo;knockers,&rdquo;
will laugh at these things, for they sound like dreams; so does every
dark science. Can you make any illiterate man believe that it is
possible to know the distance of two places by looking at them? Human
knowledge is but of small extent, its bounds are within our view, we
see nothing beyond these; the great universal creation contains powers,
etc., that we cannot so much as guess at. May there not exist beings,
and vast powers infinitely smaller than the particles of air, to whom
air is as hard a body as the diamond is to us? Why not? There is
neither great nor small, but by comparison. Our &ldquo;knockers&rdquo;
are some of these powers, the <span class="corr" id="xd24e4094" title=
"Source: guardian">guardians</span> of mines.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You remember the story in Selden&rsquo;s
Table-Talk of Sir Robert Cotton and others disputing about
Moses&rsquo;s shoe. Lady Cotton came in and asked, &lsquo;Gentlemen,
are you sure it is a shoe?&rsquo; So the first thing is to convince
mankind that there is a set of creatures, a degree or so finer than we
are, to whom we have given the name of &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; from the
sounds we hear in our mines. This is to be done by a collection of
their actions well attested, and that is what I have begun to do, and
then let everyone judge for himself<span class="corr" id="xd24e4099"
title="Source: :">.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We do not hear of &ldquo;Knockers&rdquo; in
Cardiganshire now; in Cornwall, however, it is said that they still
haunt the mines, and sometimes, with a sound of knocking and singing,
they guide a lucky miner to find good ore. The &ldquo;Knockers&rdquo;
were, it was once thought, &ldquo;the Souls of the Jews who crucified
our Saviour.&rdquo; At least it seems that that was the belief in
Cornwall. Perhaps it would be of interest to add that there were
Cornishmen among the miners of Cardiganshire when Mr. Lewis Morris
wrote the two letters I have just given. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">A STORY OF PONT EINION (EINION BRIDGE) TREGARON.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. John Jones, Pontrhydfendigaid, who is now
about 95 years of age, related to me the following tale seven years
ago:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Long ago, when much of the land where now stand the
farms of Ystrad-Caron, Penylan, and Penybont, was a Common, a gentleman
named Einion, and his wife, came from Abergwaun (Fishguard) and settled
in the neighbourhood of Tregaron. Einion inclosed much of the land on
the banks of the river Teivy in that part, and built a fine mansion
which he called Ystrad-Caron, and soon became a most influential man in
the neighbourhood, especially as he was well-to-do, and had generously
constructed at his own expense, a bridge over the river for the
convenience of the poor people of Tregaron and the surrounding
districts. He also loved above everything his wife, and his harp, and
was considered one of the best players on that instrument in Wales;
but, unfortunately, as time went on, he failed to derive any pleasure
from his surroundings and soon became subject to
&ldquo;melancholia,&rdquo; imagining that the place was haunted by some
evil genius.</p>
<p class="par">At last, he was persuaded by his medical adviser to seek
a change of scenery by going to stay for a while in Pembrokeshire, his
native place. Soon after his arrival at Fishguard, he took a short sea
voyage from that port, but after some adventures, he and others of his
fellow passengers were taken prisoners by a French Man of War.</p>
<p class="par">After spending many years of his lifetime inside the
strong walls of a French prison, he at last succeeded to escape, and
soon found his way once more to the neighbourhood of Tregaron in
Cardiganshire; but to his great astonishment, as he neared his own
house, Ystrad-Caron, after so many years&rsquo; absence, he heard some
music and dancing.</p>
<p class="par">Clothed in rags he knocked at the back door, and
pretended to be a tramp. One of the maid servants took compassion on
the &ldquo;poor old tramp,&rdquo; and allowed him to come in and warm
himself near the kitchen fire.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are very busy here to-day,&rdquo; said she to
him, &ldquo;our mistress who has been a widow for many years is about
to get married again, and the bride and bridegroom and a party of
invited guests are now in the parlour, but, unfortunately, not one of
those present is able to tune the harp, a fine old instrument which
belonged to the lady&rsquo;s first husband who went away from home and
got drowned at sea many years ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;Please ask
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>them to allow me to tune the harp,&rdquo; said
Einion to the maid. The girl then went to inform her mistress that
there was an old man in the kitchen who could tune the harp for
them.</p>
<p class="par">Einion now entered the parlour, and to the astonishment
of the bride and bridegroom and the guests, soon tuned the harp; and as
soon as he began to play an old favourite tune of his:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p lang="cy" class="line">&ldquo;Myfi bia&rsquo;m ty, a&rsquo;m telyn,
a&rsquo;m t&acirc;n,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">(My house, and my harp, and my fire are mine).</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The lady of the house recognised him at once as
her husband.</p>
<p class="par">Then turning to the young bridegroom to whom she was
engaged to be married, addressed him thus:&mdash;&ldquo;You may go now,
as my husband has come home to me once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A short time after my visit to Mr. J. Jones,
Pontrhydfendigaid, I went to Tregaron, where I found out from Mr.
Jenkin Lloyd (formerly of Pant), and others, that the story of Pont
Einion (Einion Bridge) was well-known in the neighbourhood, but that
Einion during the many years he was away from home, was not in prison
but among the Fairies.</p>
<p class="par">It seems probable that the above story is a modern local
version of a tale which is to be found in the Iolo MSS.
entitled:&mdash;&ldquo;Einion Ap Gwalchmai and the Lady of the
Greenwood,&rdquo; which I introduce here for comparison:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Einion, the son of Gwalchmai, the son of Meilir, of
Treveilir in Anglesey, married Angharad, the daughter of Ednyved
Vychan.</p>
<p class="par">As he was one fine summer morning walking in the woods
of Treveilir, he beheld a graceful slender lady of elegant growth, and
delicate features; and her complexion surpassing every white and red in
the morning dawn, and the mountain snow, and every beautiful colour in
the blossoms of wood, field and hill. He felt in his heart an
inconceivable commotion of affection, and he approached her in a
courteous manner, and she also approached him in the same manner; and
he saluted her, and she returned his salutation; and by these mutual
salutations he perceived that his society was not disagreeable to her.
He then chanced to cast his eye upon her foot, and he saw that she had
hoofs instead of feet, and he became exceedingly dissatisfied. But she
told him that his dissatisfaction was all in vain. &ldquo;Thou
must&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;follow me wheresoever I go, as long as I
continue in my beauty, for this is the consequence of our mutual
affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he requested of her permission to go to his house
to take leave of, and to say farewell to his wife, Angharad, and his
son Einion. &ldquo;I&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;shall be with thee,
invisible to all but to thyself; go visit thy wife and thy son.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">So he went, and the Goblin; and when he saw Angharad his
wife, he saw her a hag-like one grown old, but he retained the
recollection of days past, and still felt extreme affection for her,
but he was not able to loose himself from the bond in which he was.
&ldquo;It is necessary for me&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to part for a
time, I know not how long from thee Angharad, and from thee my son
Einion,&rdquo; and they wept together, and broke a gold ring between
them; he kept one half, and Angharad the other; and they took their
leave of each other, and he went with the Lady of the Wood, and he knew
not where; for a powerful illusion was upon him, and saw not any place,
a person, or object under its true and proper appearance, excepting the
half of the ring alone. And after being a long time, he knew not how
long, with the Goblin, the Lady of the Wood, he looked one morning as
the sun was rising upon the half of the ring, and he bethought him to
place it in the most precious place he could and resolved to put it
under his eyelid; and as he was endeavouring to do so, he could see a
man in white apparel, and mounted on a snow-white horse, coming towards
him, and that person asked him what he did there; and he told him that
he was cherishing an afflicting remembrance of his wife Angharad.
&ldquo;Dos&rsquo;t thou desire to see her,&rdquo; said the man in
white, &ldquo;get up on this horse behind me&rdquo;; and that Einion
did, and looking around he could not see any appearance of the Lady of
the Wood, the Goblin; excepting the track of hoofs of marvellous and
monstrous size, as if journeying towards the north. &ldquo;What
delusion art thou under?&rdquo; said the man in white. Then Einion
answered him and told everything, how it occurred betwixt him and the
Goblin. &ldquo;Take this white staff in thy hand,&rdquo; said the man
in white; and Einion took it. And the man in white told him to desire
whatever he wished for. The first thing he desired was to see the Lady
of the Wood, for he was not yet completely delivered from the illusion.
And she appeared to him in size a hideous and monstrous witch, a
thousand times more repulsive of aspect than the most frightful things
seen upon earth. And Einion uttered a cry from terror; and the man in
white cast his cloak over Einion, and in less than a twinkling Einion
alighted as he wished on the hill of Treveilir, by his own house, where
he knew scarcely anyone, nor did anyone know him. After the Goblin had
left Einion, the son of Gwalchmai, she went to Treveilir in the form of
an honourable and powerful nobleman elegantly and sumptuously
appareled, and possessed of an incalculable amount of gold and silver,
and also in the prime of life, that is thirty years of age. And he
placed a letter in Angharad&rsquo;s hand in which it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>was
stated that Einion had died in Norway more than nine years before, and
he then exhibited his gold and wealth to Angharad; <span class="corr"
id="xd24e4149" title="Source: an">and</span> she, having in the course
of time lost much of her regret, listened to his affectionate address.
And the illusion fell upon her, and seeing that she should become a
noble lady higher than any in Wales, she named a day for her marriage
with him. And there was a great preparation of every elegant and
sumptuous kind of apparel, and of meats and drinks, and of every
honourable guest, and every excellence of song and string, and every
preparation of banquet and festive entertainment. And when the
honourable saw a particularly beautiful harp in Angharad&rsquo;s room,
he wished to have it played on; and the harpers present, the best in
Wales, tried to put it in tune, but were not able. And when everything
was made ready for to proceed to Church to be married, Einion came into
the house and Angharad saw him as an old decrepit, withered,
gray-haired man, stooping with age, and dressed in rags, and she asked
him if he would turn the spit whilst the meat was roasting. &ldquo;I
will,&rdquo; said he and went about the work with the white staff in
his hand after the manner of a man carrying a pilgrim&rsquo;s staff.
And after dinner had been prepared, all the minstrels failing to put
the harp in tune for Angharad, Einion got up and took it in his hand,
and tuned it, and played on it the air which Angharad loved. And she
marvelled exceedingly, and asked him who he was. And he answered in
song and stanza thus:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Einion the golden-hearted, am I called by all
around;</p>
<p class="line">The son of Gwalchmai, Ap Meilir</p>
<p class="line">My fond illusion continued long,</p>
<p class="line">Evil thought of for my lengthened stay.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Where has thou been?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In Kent, in Gwent, in the wood in Monmouth, in

<p class="line">And in the Valley of Gwyn, the son of Nudd,</p>
<p class="line">See the bright gold is the token.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">And he gave her the ring.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Look not on the whitened hue of the hair.</p>
<p class="line">Where once my <span class="corr" id="xd24e4179" title=

<p class="line">Now gray, without disguise, where once it was

<p class="line">The blossoms of the grave&mdash;the end of all men.</p>
<p class="line">The fate that so long affected me, it was time that

<p class="line">Never was Angharad out of my remembrance,</p>
<p class="line">Einion was by thee forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And she could not bring him to her
recollection.</p>
<p class="par">Then said he to the guests:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;If I have lost her whom I loved, the fair one of
the polished mind,</p>
<p class="line xd24e550">The daughter of Ednyved Vychan;</p>
<p class="line">I have not lost (so get you out)&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Either my bed, or my house, or my fire.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And upon that he placed the white staff in
Angharad&rsquo;s hand, and instantly the Goblin which she had hitherto
seen as a handsome and honourable nobleman, appeared to her as a
monster, inconceivably hideous; and fainted from fear, and <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e4209" title="Source: Einon">Einion</span> supported her
until she revived. And when she opened her eyes, she saw there neither
the Goblin, nor any of the guests, or of the minstrels, nor anything
whatever except Einion, and her son and the harp, and the house in its
domestic arrangement, and the dinner on the table, casting its savoury
odour around. And they sat down to eat; Einion and Angharad and Einion
their son; and exceeding great was the enjoyment. And they saw the
illusion which the demoniacal <span class="corr" id="c143" title=
"Corrected by author from: Boblin">Goblin</span> had cast over them.
And by this perchance may be seen that love of female beauty and
gentleness is the greatest fascination of man; the love of honours with
their vanities and riches, is the greatest fascination of woman. No man
will forget his wife, unless he sets his heart on the beauty of
another; nor woman her husband, unless she sets her heart on the riches
and honour of lordly vaingloriousness and the pomp of pride. And thus
it ends<span class="corr" id="xd24e4215" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Ednyved Vychan, whose name is mentioned in the beginning
of the above story as Einion&rsquo;s father-in-law, was Lord of
Brynffenigl in Denbighshire, and flourished seven hundred years ago. He
was a most powerful chieftain, and from him descended in the male line
Henry VII. King of England, an ancestor to nearly all if not all the
present monarchs of Europe.</p>

<h3 class="main">MERMAIDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It seems probable that the tradition of Mermaids
is of the same origin as that of fairies.</p>
<p class="par">In Campbell&rsquo;s Superstitions of the Scottish
Highlands, it is stated that a man in North Harris, caught a mermaid on
a rock, and to procure her release, she granted him his three wishes.
He became a skilful herb-doctor, who could cure the King&rsquo;s evil
and other diseases ordinarily incurable. This reminds us of the Fairy
Lady of Llyn y Fanfach in Carmarthenshire, revealing to her sons the
medical qualities of certain herbs and plants, thus enabling them to
become eminent doctors.</p>
<p class="par">In the Welsh tales the mermaid is described as half
woman and half fish: above the waist a lovely woman, but below the
waist like a fish. There are several mermaid stories on the west coast
of Wales, or perhaps, different versions of the same tale.</p>
<p class="par">It was believed that vengeance overtook those who showed
cruelty to these beings, and there is a tradition still extant in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>Carmarthenshire, that a man who killed one of
them in the neighbourhood of Pembrey, or Kidwelly, brought a curse upon
himself, his family and his descendants until the ninth generation.</p>
<p class="par">In times gone by, it seems that Cardiganshire with a
sea-coast of about fifty miles, was noted for its mermaids; and
according to Dryton, at the Battle of Agincourt, the county had
&ldquo;a mermaid sitting on a rock,&rdquo; as armorial bearings.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE MERMAID AND THE FISHERMEN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. Lewis, Henbant, an old man who lives in the
neighbourhood of Llanarth, Cardiganshire, told me the following tale
five years ago, though I am indebted for some particulars to the Rev.
D. Lewis, Vicar of Llansantffread:&mdash;In times gone by a mermaid was
often seen on a rock known as Careg Ina, near New Quay. One day this
sea creature became entangled in the nets of some fishermen who were
out fishing some considerable distance from the land. She entreated the
men to disentangle her, and allow her to return to the water. Her
request was granted, and in gratitude the mermaid warned them of a
coming storm, and advised them to make for the shore without delay.
This they did hurriedly, and as they were nearing the land a terrific
storm came on suddenly, and it was with difficulty that they managed to
land safely. Other fishermen in another boat on the very same day, not
having the advantage of being warned by the mermaid, were caught by the
storm and met with a watery grave.</p>
<p class="par">I have also discovered a version of this story at
Aberporth, a seaside village some distance to the South of New
Quay.</p>
<p class="par">It was formerly believed that there were mermen as well
as mermaids, though I have no Welsh tale of a merman.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following tale appeared in Welsh fifty years
ago in &ldquo;Y Brython,&rdquo; Vol. I. page 73; and the writer was the
late eminent Welshman Gwynionydd, father of the present Vicar of
Lledrod:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;On a fine afternoon in September in the beginning
of the last century, a fisherman named Pergrin proceeded to a recess in
the rock near Pen Cemmes, (Pembrokeshire), and found there a mermaid
doing her hair, and he took the water lady prisoner to his boat. We
cannot imagine why the lady had not been more on her guard to avoid
such a calamity; but if sea maidens are anything like land maidens,
they often forget their duties when engaged in dealing with the oil of
Maccassar, and making themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>ready to meet the young men.
We know not what language is used by sea maidens ... but this one this
time at any rate, talked, it is said, very good Welsh; for when she was
in despair in Pergrin&rsquo;s custody weeping copiously, and with her
tresses all dishevelled, she called out &ldquo;Pergrin, if thou wilt
let me go, I will give three shouts in the time of thy greatest
need.&rdquo; So, in wonder and fear he let her go to walk the streets
of the deep and visit her sweethearts there. Days and weeks passed
without Pergrin seeing her after this; but one hot afternoon, when the
sea was pretty calm, and the fishermen had no thought of danger, behold
his old acquaintance showing her head and locks, and shouting out in a
loud voice: &ldquo;Pergrin! Pergrin! Pergrin! take up thy nets! take up
thy nets! take up thy nets!&rdquo; Pergrin and his companion instantly
obeyed the message, and drew their nets in with great haste. In they
went, passed the bar, and by the time they had reached the Pwll Cam,
the most terrible storm had overspread the sea, while he and his
companion were safe on land. Twice nine others had gone out with them,
but they were all drowned, without having the chance of obeying the
warning of the water lady.</p>

<p class="par">I have translated the above tale as literally as
possible, almost word for word, and in English it reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">In the month of July, 1826, a farmer from the parish of
Llanuwchaiarn, about three miles from Aberystwyth, whose house is
within 300 feet of the seashore, descended the rock, when the sun was
shining beautifully upon the sea, and he saw a woman (as he thought)
washing herself in the sea within a stone&rsquo;s throw of him. At
first, he modestly turned back; but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection
thought that a woman would not go so far out into the sea, as it was
flooded at the time, and he was certain that the water was six feet
deep in the spot where he saw her standing. After considering the
matter, he threw himself down on his face and crept on to the edge of
the precipice from which place he had a good view of her for more than
half-an-hour. After scrutinizing her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>himself, he crept
back to call his family to see this wonderful sight. After telling them
what he had seen, he directed them from the door where to go and to
creep near the rock as he had done. Some of them went when they were
only half dressed, for it was early in the morning, and they had only
just got up from bed. Arriving at the spot, they looked at her for
about ten minutes, as the farmer was calling his wife and the younger
child. When the wife came on, she did not throw herself down as the
others had done, but walked on within sight of the creature; but as
soon as the mermaid saw her, she dived into the water, and swam away
till she was about the same distance from them as she was when she was
first seen. The whole family, husband, wife, children, menservants and
maid-servants, altogether twelve in number, ran along the shore for
more than half-a-mile, and during most of that time, they saw her in
the sea, and sometimes her head and shoulders were upwards out of the
water. There was a large stone, more than a yard in height, in the sea,
on which she stood when she was first seen. She was standing out of the
water from her waist up, and the whole family declared that she was
exactly the same as a young woman of about 18 years of age, both in
shape and stature. Her hair was short, and of a dark colour; her face
rather handsome, her neck and arms were like those of any ordinary
woman, her breast blameless and her skin whiter than that of any person
they had ever seen before. Her face was towards the shore. She bent
herself down frequently, as if taking up water, and then holding her
hand before her face for about half-a-minute. When she was thus bending
herself, there was to be seen some black thing as if there was a tail
turning up behind her. She often made some noise like sneezing, which
caused the rock to echo. The farmer who had first seen her, and had had
the opportunity of looking at her for some time, said that he had never
seen but very few women so handsome in appearance as this mermaid.</p>
<p class="par">All the family, the youngest of whom is now eleven years
old, are now alive, and we obtained this account, word for word, as it
is given here, from them themselves within the last month. <span class=

<p class="par xd24e4279"><span class="xd24e4279init">T</span>he belief
in the existence of Fairies in Wales has almost died out, but we still
find many people who are more or less superstitious with regard to
ghosts, spirits, etc., and the belief in death omens is rather popular,
even among educated people.</p>
<p class="par">The majority of the Welsh ghosts were supposed to be the
spirits or shades of departed mortals, re-appearing on account of some
neglected duty, and in many cases to point out some hidden treasure;
for it was thought that if a person dies, while his money (or any
metal) is still hidden secretly, the spirit of that person cannot rest
until it is revealed. It was also supposed that the spirits of the
murdered haunted the place where their unburied bodies lay, or until
vengeance overtook the murderer, &ldquo;and the wicked were doomed to
walk the earth until they were laid in lake or river, or in the Red
Sea.&rdquo; It was also thought in former days, if not at present, that
the evil one himself appears sometimes in some form or other; but good
spirits are seen as well as bad ones. I have heard it said by some that
only those who have been born in the night time have the power to see
spirits; others say that spirits take more fancy to some persons than
others. It was also thought that if two persons were together, one only
could see the spirit, to the other he was invisible, and to one person
only would the Spirit speak, and this he would do when addressed; for
according to the laws of the Spirit world, a Spirit or a ghost has no
power of speech until first spoken to.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Its persistency in haunting is due to its eager
desire to speak, and tell its urgent errand, but the person haunted
must take his courage in both hands and put the question to the issue.
Having done so, he is booked for the end of the business, be it what it
may. The mode of speech adopted must not vary, in addressing a Spirit;
in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, it must be addressed,
and not otherwise. Its business must be demanded; three times the
question must be repeated, unless the ghost answer earlier. When it
answers, it speaks in a low hollow voice, stating its desire; and it
must not be interrupted while speaking for to <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e4285" title="Source: interupt">interrupt</span> it is dangerous
in the extreme. At the close of <span class="corr" id="xd24e4288"
title="Source: it">its</span> remarks, questions are in order. They
must be promptly delivered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>however, or the ghost will vanish.
They must bear on the business in hand; it is offended if asked as to
its state, or other idle questions born of curiosity. Neglect to obey
the ghost&rsquo;s injunctions will lead to much annoyance, and
eventually to dire results. At first the Spirit will appear with a
discontented visage, next with an angry one, and finally with a
countenance distorted with the most ferocious rage.&rdquo;

<p class="par">Men sometimes were transported by the spirits through
the air, and the Fairies did this also as well as ghosts. About two
years ago, an old man at Llansadwrn, Carmarthenshire, gave me a
remarkable account of the transportation of a well-known character who
lived in that parish some years ago known as &ldquo;Evan y
Gweydd&rdquo; (Evan the Weaver). A version of the story had appeared in
Welsh twenty-five years ago, in an interesting little book entitled
&ldquo;Lloffion Adgof,&rdquo; by T. Edwards.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">THE WEAVER OF LLANSADWRN TRANSPORTED THROUGH THE AIR
BY A SPIRIT.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One night Evan y Gweydd found himself speaking
with a Spirit who appeared to him in the form of a gentleman outside
the house. The gentleman asked him whether he would do one thing at his
request. &ldquo;Yes, if I can,&rdquo; said Evan, in reply. &ldquo;That
is a promise which must be kept,&rdquo; said the spirit<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e4303" title="Source: .">,</span> &ldquo;and thou shalt
have no peace until thou hast performed it; name the time and sooner
the better.&rdquo; Evan said, &ldquo;three weeks to to-night.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Spirit, and off it went. Poor Evan by
this began to feel very sorry for making such a promise, and when the
time came round when he was to fulfil his promise, he barred the door
of the house and went to bed; but he was not there long before he was
thrown down on the floor, and found himself pushed out through the wide
open door, unceremoniously, hardly having time to put on his clothes.
After going out he saw the same gentleman as before, or rather the
spirit which assumed the form of a gentleman who ordered Evan to follow
him without delay to a place called Glan-ty-Bedw, where there was a
very large stone, with an iron chest concealed beneath it. Then the
spirit ordered him to take hold of the box and carry it and throw it
into the Fanfach Lake many miles away. On Sunday morning as they passed
through the village of Myddfe on their way to this lake, Evan noticed
the people going to Church, some of whom he knew, but it seems that
they did not see him, and his companion, or at least they did not seem
to notice them. After reaching the lake and throwing in the chest,
there came <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>thunder and lightning, and Evan was carried
through the air in a kind of half trance. When he came to himself he
found himself on the banks of the river Towy, between that river and
Llansadwrn, and not far from his home. When he reached the house he
went to bed, and was very ill for some time. According to some versions
of the story, the spirit compelled him to throw an iron into the Cothy
river near Edwinsford, as well as a chest into the Fan Lake.</p>
<p class="par">In aerial journey of this kind, the spirit generally
gives the mortal the choice of being transported &ldquo;above wind,
amid wind, or below wind.&rdquo; The man who chooses to go above wind
is borne to an altitude somewhat equal to that of a balloon, so high
that he is in danger of being frightened to death. But choosing the
below wind is quite as bad and even worse, for the hapless mortal is
then dragged through bush and briar. The safest way is always to
remember to select the middle course (amid wind), for this ensures a
pleasant transportation at a moderate elevation equally removed from
the branches and the clouds.</p>
<p class="par">There was a certain man in the neighbourhood of
Pontyberem, in Carmarthenshire, to whom a spirit appeared almost every
night, and offered him an aerial journey of this description, giving
him the choice of above wind, amid wind, or below wind, and on one
occasion he was dragged by the ghost through bush and briar that his
clothes were all in rags.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the parish of Llangeler, Carmarthenshire, May
21st., 1719, a spirit, which continued for some time, began to throw
stones at those who were in the field. On Thursday in Whitsun week, at
eight in the morning, the thrashing began (at a farm) and at the same
time he (the spirit) began to throw stones. At first it was one of the
men who were thrashing that noticed a stone descending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>on
the thrashing floor. The second stone fell on the leg of the housemaid,
wounding her; and after this, very shortly, they filled the thrashing
floor and the place around. The men who were thrashing gave up their
work, and went to see who were throwing them, but could see no one.</p>
<p class="par">Friday.&mdash;The servant maid in the garden was struck
three times. Several of the children were struck till they went out of
the house. A large number of people came together to see these wonders,
and all who came were allowed to see the stones descending.</p>
<p class="par">Saturday.&mdash;The servant maid and one of the
thrashers were struck. Some of the stones were rattling, and something
like marks on several of them. The stones were not seen till they fell,
and when they were taken up marks of them were on the floor as if they
had been there from the year before. A large pole came right across the
window without any one visibly bringing it. Some people believed not,
till they sent messengers to see, and to bring home some of the stones
to their houses. A big stump of wood was taken up from the boiler to
the house top, and fell in another place.</p>
<p class="par">Sunday.&mdash;A large number of people came together to
see, and several of them cursing and swearing, and speaking lightly and
blasphemously. Big stones fell on the loft of the house, but were not
seen till they had descended. An iron bar was struck out of the window,
and another one bent as a packsaddle&rsquo;s hook; and the window was
broken all to pieces. After dark the stones came into the beds, and
window frames went to the loft, so that the family of the house were
obliged to get up from their beds and go to a neighbour&rsquo;s house.
Nothing but stones could be seen filling the house and surrounding
it.</p>
<p class="par">Wednesday Night.&mdash;The barn and the corn as well as
many other things were burnt; he (the spirit) was throwing stones every
day, though not every hour. Sometimes the stones were thrown as fast as
one could reckon them, most of which were river stones, and some of
them weighing about seven pounds or more. Neighbours came together to
pray to God in the house, and there was not much noise in the house
that night. Many other things were done by the spirit, but he at last
ceased.<a id="xd24e4362" name="xd24e4362"></a></p>

fainted, and did not leave the field, till he was found there by

Bard, Dafydd Ap Gwilym was born, and situated six miles from
Aberystwyth in Cardiganshire. Some years ago the respectable and
industrious family who lived there at the time, were often disturbed by
some unearthly being who generally made his appearance in the depth of
night, as it is the case with spirits. This unwelcome visitor aroused
the whole family by walking up and down the stairs, or from one room
into another. Sometimes he closed the doors behind him, making such
noise as to strike terror to the hearts of all in the house. At times,
he lighted up the whole house at once with gleaming light, and the next
moment vanished as suddenly as he came, leaving behind him utter
darkness. Occasionally, the same ghost was seen by some of the
servantmen, who had been out courting, walking across the farmyard in
the form of a &ldquo;white lady,&rdquo; appearing as a tall handsome
lady attired in lustring white dress, and her face covered by silken
veil. This &ldquo;White Lady&rdquo; walked towards the young men,

fire. People were so terrified by such sights, that several families,
one after another moved away from the house. One Sunday evening,
however, about the beginning of winter, when all the family as usual
had gone to chapel, except the servant maid, who did not feel well,
<a id="xd24e4394" name="xd24e4394"></a>her lover came to keep her
company. Naturally, the young man and the young woman began to talk
about the ghost, and Evan (for that was the young man&rsquo;s name)
laughed, and boasted what he was going to do should the disturber
appear. But the next moment, without the least notice, a lady in her
white dress stood right in the middle of the room, with her face
uncovered, and her brown curly hair down over her shoulders. She held
in one hand a comb and in the other a roll of paper, but she did not
whisper a word. The servant maid, and her young man who had just been
boasting shuddered in terror, and dared not move or utter a word. The
&ldquo;lady&rdquo; walked round the apartment several times; then
suddenly stood; and having opened the door through which she had
entered without opening, beckoned the young man to follow her. As he
dared not disobey, he followed her up stairs, into a dark back room,
but which was now lighted up in some mysterious way. With her finger
she pointed out a particular corner under the low roof, at which place
the young man with his trembling hand found some hard parcel carefully
tied in an old woollen stocking. When he opened it he found it full of
money, and at the same moment the &ldquo;White Lady&rdquo; vanished and
never disturbed the house again.</p>

PARISH OF LLANAFAN.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Crosswood Park, the fine residence of my esteemed
young friend the Earl of Lisburne, is situated about nine miles from
Aberystwyth. About two miles from the Park is a bridge over the river
Ystwyth, known as Pont Llanafan (Llanafan Bridge).</p>
<p class="par">This bridge is supposed to be haunted, and I have been
told that a ghost has been seen there lately by a gentleman who lives
in the district.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. John Jones, an old man of 95, who lives at
Pontrhydfendigaid, informed me that the origin of this ghost is to be
traced to some former days when retired pirates lived in a house near
the Bridge, and who were supposed to have hidden some treasure in the
spot. Mr. Jones also gave me the following story of a farmer named
Edwards, who lived in a small farm house near the bridge two or three
generations ago:&mdash;The poor farmer worked very hard, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>but
for some time he was continually molested by a mischievous ghost day
and night. In the evening when Edwards sat down in the corner eating
his supper, which consisted of bread and milk, stones came down through
the chimney, or ashes were thrown into his milk by some invisible hand.
At another time the ghost was heard thrashing in the barn, or meddling
with something continually. One day when the man was engaged in making
a new fence round his field, the troublesome visitor from the other
world kept with him all day, and threw down both the fence and the
gate. Edwards at last decided to address the spirit in these
word:&mdash;&rdquo;<span lang="cy">Yn enw Duw, paham yr wyt yn fy
aflonyddi o hyd?</span>&rdquo; which means in English, &ldquo;In the
name of God, why doest thou trouble me continually?&rdquo; We are not
told what was the reply of the spirit, but it was generally believed by
the neighbours that he revealed to the farmer some hidden treasure in
an old wall not far from the house. Edwards took down this wall and
built a new house with the stones and greatly prospered. It was also
said that he had been comparatively poor once, but ever since his
conversation with the spirit, his cattle and his horses soon increased
and fortune and good luck smiled on him all round. About two years ago
when I related this story to a friend of mine who lives at
Pontrhydfendigaid, to my great surprise, his wife informed me that the
account is quite true. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I got
&pound;500 of the Ghost&rsquo;s money.&rdquo; The lady, strange to say,
happened to be a descendant, or at least a near relation of the
Llanafan farmer to whom the ghost revealed the hidden treasure.</p>
<p class="par">Not far from the same Llanafan bridge there is a rock
known as &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Craig yr Ogof</span>&rdquo; (Rock of
the Cave). Countess Amherst, (now Dowager) informed me that there is a
tradition in the neighbourhood that the Romans buried treasures
there.</p>

<p class="par first">Glanfread is a respectable farm house, but in
former days it was a mansion of some note, situated in the North of
Cardiganshire. In connection with Glanfread there is a ghost tale, and
I found the best version of it in a Welsh manuscript kindly lent me by
Dr. James, Lodge Park, Talybont:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Once upon a time there lived at this house an old
gentleman whose two nieces on one occasion came to spend with him their
Christmas holidays at Glanfread. One evening, the two young ladies, who
were sisters, and the housemaid sat down late playing cards. As they
kept on playing till a very late hour, the fire was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>going out, and they began to feel cold; so the
maiden went out of the house for some firewood in order to warm
themselves before retiring to bed. For some reason or other, however,
she was very long in returning with the wood to put on the fire, and
when she did return, she fell on the floor in a swoon, that they were
obliged to carry her to bed. Next morning when they asked what had
caused her to faint, she declined giving any reply; and even when her
master, gun in hand, threatened to take her life unless she confessed
what had happened, she <span class="corr" id="xd24e4427" title=
"Source: till">still</span> persisted in keeping all the mystery to
herself. The fact of it was, the girl kept company to one of the farm
servants, if not engaged, and very soon they were married, and took a
very large farm&mdash;a farm which is well-known in North
Cardiganshire. All their acquaintances were very greatly surprised how
could a poor servant man and servant woman afford to begin farming on
such a large scale, when it was known that they had but very little
money to start on such an undertaking. And the general opinion was that
a spirit had revealed to the servant woman some hidden treasure on the
night she fainted.</p>

<h3 class="main">A GHOST APPEARING TO POINT OUT HIDDEN TREASURE IN
RADNORSHIRE.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is a story in Radnorshire, that a palace not
far from the neighbourhood of Abbey Cwm Hir, was once haunted by a
Spirit, which appeared in various forms and made such terrible noise
that no one cared to live in the house for a long time. At last,
however, a young gentleman who had newly married had the courage to
face the ghost, and discovered most valuable treasures which had been
hidden in the ground near the house. The spot where the gold had been
buried was pointed out to the young man by the Spirit, and the house
was never haunted after this.</p>
<p class="par">It is a well-known fact that a Spirit revealed hidden
treasure to a Baptist Minister, who lived in a respectable old mansion
somewhere not far from Nevern in Pembrokeshire. I met with several
persons at Eglwyswrw and other places, who vouched for the truth of the
fact. The treasure had been hidden, so it is said, in the time of
Cromwell.</p>
<p class="par">Some of the ghosts who reveal hidden money are not
always generous. According to the Rev. Edmund Jones, the ghost of one
Anne Dewy, a woman who had hanged herself, compelled a young man in the
Vale of Towy, Carmarthenshire, to cast into the river a bag of money
which had been hid in the wall of a house. Instead of keeping the money
himself, the young man obeyed the ghost <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

judgment, and the sum concerned was &ldquo;&pound;200 or

<h3 class="main">THE POWIS CASTLE GHOST STORY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following ghost story is recorded in the
autobiography of the grandfather of the late Mr. Thomas Wright, the
eminent Shropshire antiquary:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">It had been for some time reported in the neighbourhood
that a poor unmarried woman, who was a member of the Methodist Society,
and had become serious under their ministry, had seen and conversed
with the apparition of a gentleman, who had made a strange discovery to
her. Mr. Hampson (a preacher among the Methodists about the end of the
18th century) being desirous to ascertain if there was any truth in the
story, sent for the woman, and desired her to give him an exact
relation of the whole affair from her own mouth, and as near the truth
as she possibly could. She said she was a poor woman, who got her
living by spinning hemp or line; that it was customary for the farmers
and gentlemen of that neighbourhood to grow a little hemp or line in a
corner of their fields for their own consumption, and as she was a good
hand at spinning the materials, she used to go from house to house to
inquire for work; that her method was, where they employed her, during
her stay, to have meat, and drink, and lodging (if she had occasion to
sleep with them), for her work, and what they pleased to give her
besides. That, among other places, she happened to call one day at the
Welsh Earl of Powis&rsquo;s country seat, called Redcastle, to inquire
for work, as she usually had done before. The quality were at this time
in London, and had left the steward and his wife, with other servants,
as usual, to take care of their country residence in their absence. The
steward&rsquo;s wife set her to work, and in the evening told her that
she must stay all night with them, as they had more work for her to do
next day. When bedtime arrived, two or three servants in company, with
each a lighted candle in her hand, conducted her to her lodging. They
led her to a ground room, with a boarded floor, and two sash windows.
The room was grandly furnished, and had a genteel bed in one corner of
it. They had made her a good fire, and had placed her a chair and a
table before it, and a large lighted candle upon the table. They told
her that was her bedroom, and that she might go to sleep when she
pleased. They then wished her a good night and withdrew altogether,
pulling the door quickly after them, so as to hasp the spring-snech in
the brass lock that was upon it. When they were gone, she gazed awhile
at the fine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>furniture, under no small astonishment that they
should put such a poor person as her in so grand a room, and bed, with
all the apparatus of fire, chair, table, and a candle. She was also
surprised at the circumstance of the servants coming so many together,
with each of them a candle. However, after gazing about her some little
time, she sat down and took a small Welsh Bible out of her pocket,
which she always carried about with her, and in which she usually read
a chapter&mdash;chiefly in the New Testament&mdash;before she said her
prayers and went to bed. While she was reading she heard the door open,
and turning her head, saw a gentleman enter in a gold-laced hat and
waistcoat, and the rest of his dress corresponding therewith. I think
she was very particular in describing the rest of his dress to Mr.
Hampson, and he to me at the time, but I have now forgot the other
particulars. He walked down by the sash-window to the corner of the
room and then returned. When he came to the first window in his return
(the bottom of which was nearly breast high), he rested his elbow on
the bottom of the window, and the side of his face upon the palm of the
hand, and stood in that leaning posture for some time, with his side
partly towards her. She looked at him earnestly to see if she knew him,
but, though from her frequent intercourse with them, she had a personal
knowledge of all the present family, he appeared a stranger to her. She
supposed afterwards that he stood in this manner to encourage her to
speak; but as she did not, after some little time he walked off,
pulling the door after him as the servants had done before. She began
now to be much alarmed, concluding it to be an apparition, and that
they had put her there on purpose. This was really the case. The room,
it seems, had been disturbed for a long time, so that nobody could
sleep peaceably in it, and as she passed for a very serious woman, the
servants took it into their heads to put the Methodist and Spirit
together, to see what they would make of it. Startled at this thought,
she rose from her chair, and <span class="corr" id="xd24e4450" title=
"Source: kneeling">knelt</span> down by the bedside to say her prayers.
While she was praying he came in again, walked round the room, and came
close behind her. She had it on her mind to speak, but when she
attempted it she was so very much agitated that she could not utter a
word. He walked out of the room again, pulling the door after him as
before. She begged that God would strengthen her and not suffer her to
be tried beyond what she could bear. She recovered her spirits, and
thought she felt more confidence and resolution, and determined if he
came in again she would speak to him. He presently came in again,
walked round and came behind her as before; she turned her head and
said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>&ldquo;Pray, sir, who are you, and what do you
want?&rdquo; He put up his finger, and said, &ldquo;Take up the candle
and follow me, and I will tell you.&rdquo; She got up<span class="corr"
id="xd24e4455" title="Not in source">,</span> took up the candle, and
followed him out of the room. He led her through a long boarded passage
till they came to the door of another room, which he opened and went
in. It was a small room, or what might be called a large closet.
&ldquo;As the room was small, and I believed him to be a Spirit,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I stopped at the door; he turned and said, &lsquo;Walk
in, I will not hurt you.&rsquo; So I walked in. He said, &lsquo;Observe
what I do.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I will.&rsquo; He stooped, and tore up
one of the boards of the floor, and there appeared under it a box with
an iron handle in the lid. He said, &lsquo;Do you see that box?&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;Yes, I do.&rsquo; He then stepped to one side of the
room, and showed me a crevice in the wall, where he said a key was hid
that would open it. He said &lsquo;This box and key must be taken out,
and sent to the Earl in London&rsquo; (naming the Earl, and his place
of residence in the city). He said, &lsquo;Will you see it done?&rsquo;
I said, &lsquo;I will do my best to get it done.&rsquo; He said,
&lsquo;Do, and I will trouble the house no more.&rsquo; He then walked
out of the room and left me. (He seems to have been a very civil
Spirit, and to have been very careful to affright her as little as
possible). I stepped to the room door and set up a shout. The steward
and his wife, and the other servants came to me immediately, all clung
together, with a number of lights in their hands. It seems they all had
been waiting to see the issue of the interview betwixt me and the
apparition. They asked me what was the matter? I told them the
foregoing circumstances, and showed them the box. The steward durst not
meddle with it, but his wife had more courage, and with the help of the
other servants, lugged it out, and found the key.&rdquo; She said by
their lifting it appeared to be pretty heavy, but that she did not see
it opened, and, therefore, did not know what it contained; perhaps
money, or writings of consequence to the family, or both. They took it
away with them, and she then went to bed and slept peaceably till the
morning. It appeared afterwards that they sent the box to the Earl in
London, with an account of the manner of its discovery and by whom; and
the Earl sent down orders immediately to his steward to inform the poor
woman who had been the occasion of this discovery, that if she would
come and reside in his family, she should be comfortably provided for,
for the remainder of her days; or, if she did not choose to reside
constantly with them, if she would let them know when she wanted
assistance, she should be liberally supplied, at his Lordship&rsquo;s
expense as long as he lived. And Mr. Hampson said it was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>known fact in the neighbourhood that she had
been so supplied from his Lordship&rsquo;s family from the time the
affair was said to have happened, and continued to be so at the time
she gave Mr. Hampson this account.</p>
<p class="par">To touch or dig for buried treasures guarded by a ghost
without the ghost&rsquo;s consent always brings thunder and lightning.
Such is the tradition in connection with &ldquo;Carreg y Bwci&rdquo; on
the top of Craig Twrch, on the borders of Carmarthenshire and
Cardiganshire.</p>
<p class="par">Many of the tales displaying the motive, on the
ghost&rsquo;s part of a duty to perform&mdash;sometimes clearly
defining, sometimes vaguely suggesting it, as in the story of Noe.</p>
<p class="par">The evening was far gone when a traveller of the name of
Noe arrived at an Inn in Pembrokeshire, and called for refreshments.
After remaining sometime he remarked that he must proceed on his
journey. &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said the astonished landlord, &lsquo;You
will not travel at night for it <span class="corr" id="xd24e4466"
title="Not in source">is</span> said that a ghost haunts that
road,<span class="corr" id="xd24e4469" title=

the nights are cold to wait for Noe. O, I am the man sought
for,<span class="corr" id="xd24e4472" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> said he, and immediately departed; but,
strange to say, neither Noe nor the ghost was ever heard of
afterwards.</p>
<p class="par">An old woman in Pembrokeshire informed me that the scene
of the above tale was a house in the neighbourhood of Letterston.</p>
<p class="par">Another story of this class appeared in an interesting
little Welsh book entitled &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Ysten
Sioned</span>,&rdquo; published by Hughes and Son, Wrexham.</p>
<p class="par">There was a farmhouse in a certain part of West Wales,
in which a large and respectable family lived. But there was one room
in the house haunted by a troublesome spirit which often cried out in a
mournful voice, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Hir yw&rsquo;r dydd, a hir
yw&rsquo;r nos, a hir yw aros Arawn</span>&rdquo; (long is the day, and
long is the night, and long is waiting for Arawn). Things went on in
this manner for a long time, and not one hardly ventured to open the
door of that room. But one cold winter evening when every member of the
family sat around the fire, before supper, somebody called at the door
of the house, and a stranger was welcomed in to warm himself by the
fire. The stranger asked for some food and a bed for the night. He was
told he was welcomed of food, but that they were sorry they could not
offer him a bed, as all the beds were hardly enough for themselves, and
that the only spare bed-room in the house was haunted. Then the
stranger begged to be allowed to sleep in that room, as he felt sure
that there was nothing to do him harm there. The man appeared very
tired, and spoke <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span>but little except in reply to questions,
and when it was found out that his name was &ldquo;Arawn,&rdquo; all
the family looked into each&rsquo;s face in great surprise. The
stranger presently went to bed in the haunted room, and strange to say
everything was quiet in that room that night, that is, no spirit was
heard as usual crying and moving things about. When the family got up
next morning, the first thing was to find out what kind of night the
stranger passed in the haunted room, but to the surprise of all the man
was gone, and the ghost was also gone, for the room was never haunted
afterwards.</p>

in that neighbourhood had gone from home, for some months, and just
about the time when he was expected to return the little girl was one
day walking along the road near the village, about two o&rsquo;clock in

along the road towards her, and looked at her, and then suddenly
disappeared through a gate into an adjoining field. She was very much
surprised, as the man was not expected home till next day. The next
moment two sisters of the man appeared on the scene, and the girl
informed them that she had just seen their brother, and inquired
whether they had met him as they passed along the same road about the
same time. But they in reply positively affirmed that they had seen no
sight of him on the road or anywhere else since he left home, and that
the girl must have been dreaming or inventing some idle tale, for their
brother was not returning home till to-morrow. About 2 p.m., the next

were from home. But he was informed at the inn that there was a London
doctor staying at Hafod. He determined, whether he could or could not,
induce this gentleman to accompany him to Swyddffynnon, to go there.

One particular day, the children went out to play as they often did.
When they came to a certain spot which served them as a playground,

children; but just as they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"

CARMARTHENSHIRE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was an old belief among the Welsh people in
former times that the spirit of a suicide was doomed to walk the earth
as a punishment. Several versions of the well-known Kidwely Legend have
already appeared, but a book of West Wales Folk-Lore would be
incomplete without it.</p>
<p class="par">Sir Elidir Ddu was a Lord of Kidwely. He had two sons,
Griffith and Rhys, and one beautiful daughter named Nest.</p>
<p class="par">The Crusades had been proclaimed, and this Elidir Ddu
was preparing to depart, and accompanied by his youngest son Rhys; but
the eldest son Griffith and Nest, the only daughter, remained at home
in Kidwely Castle, as well as another fair young lady whose name was
Gwladys, a niece of Sir Elidir, and cousin to Nest. Nest was in love
with a handsome young Norman named Sir Walter Mansel, her cousin
Gwladys also was in love with him, but the young man was true to Nest.
Griffith loved Gwladys, but she did not like him as she wanted Sir
Walter Mansel. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>complicated matters very much. Nest&rsquo;s
father before he had left to the Holy Land, had forbidden the young
Norman the house, and now the young lady&rsquo;s brother, Griffith,
guarded the place against him; but the sanguine lover (Sir W. M.) found
means of meeting the fair Nest in the country round, and many stolen
interviews were held. But the jealous Gwladys watched Nest, and found
out her place of meeting with her lover, which was Pont-y-Gwendraeth,
and she informed Griffith of it. Griffith was in love with Gwladys, but
she had snubbed him hopelessly. Now, however, in order to use him as an
accomplice in her revenge, she flattered his hopes with feigned
kindness, and wrought him up to such a pitch of fury against the
Norman, that he agreed to join her to destroy the young lover by fixing
upon a bad fellow called Merig Maneg to carry out the evil deed. The
next trysting place of the lovers was, by some means ascertained to be
a bridge over the tidal portion of the Gwendraeth, and as Sir W. came
forward to greet his lady-love an arrow whistled from a reed bed and
pierced his side. The villain Merig, then rushed from his hiding place,
and before the very eyes of Nest, hurled Walter&rsquo;s body into the
rushing tide. The young lady overcome with horror, gave a wild shriek
of despair and plunged in after the hapless knight. After this, the
villain Merig was haunted by Nest&rsquo;s spirit, and on one occasion,
she told him that her spirit was doomed to walk the earth as a
punishment for her suicide unless a marriage should take place between
one of her father&rsquo;s descendants and a member of the Mansel
family, and that until that did occur she would appear on
Pont-y-Gwendraeth to give warning of the approaching death of every
member of the family. From that day the Bridge became known as
<span lang="cy">Pont-yr-yspryd-gwyn</span>, and for generations a white
lady occasionally appeared, giving utterance to a wild unearthly shriek
and vanish.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Mr. Charles Wilkins in his &ldquo;Tales and Sketches of
Wales,&rdquo; gives the following sequel to the story:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">In 1775, Mr. Rhys, a lineal descendant of Rhys Ddu, of
Kidwely Castle, a magistrate, was returning one evening from Quarter
Sessions when he was startled by seeing a white figure flit rapidly
across the Bridge, and <span class="corr" id="xd24e4666" title=
"Source: disappeared">disappear</span> over it into the water. His
horse trembled and refused to go on. Mr. Rhys thought of the Ghost
Story and prediction, and riding towards Kidwely, noticed a large crowd
and heard that a shocking murder had been committed upon a poor old
woman. He entered the cottage and discovered a small portion of a
man&rsquo;s coat sleeve lying upon the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

found it belonged to &ldquo;Will Maneg.&rdquo; Will was arrested,
confessed, and was hanged on Pembrey mountain, while as still further
to strengthen the prediction, Mr. Rhys was informed that day of the
death of his brother Arthur of the R.N., who was drowned at sea; and
also of his wife&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s death, Lady Mansel, of Iscoed,
who was burnt to death at Kidwely.</p>

<h3 class="main">A PEMBROKESHIRE GHOST HAUNTING A SHIP.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Sometimes we hear of ghosts at sea, and the
following account of a Ghost on board H.M.S. &ldquo;Asp,&rdquo; which
was written by Capt. Alldridge, R.N., Commander of that vessel,
appeared in the &ldquo;Pembroke County Guardian,&rdquo; February 16th,
1901.</p>
<p class="par dateline">March 15th, 1867.</p>
<p class="par">My dear Sir,&mdash;I herewith readily comply with your
request as far as I am able, respecting the unaccountable
&ldquo;apparition&rdquo; on board my ship. Call it ghost or what you
will, still I assure you that which I am going to relate is what really
did take place, and much as I was, and am, a sceptic in ghost stories,
I must confess myself completely at a loss to account by natural causes
for that which did actually occur. Many years having elapsed since I
retired from active service I am unable to recollect all the dates with
exactness, but I will give them as far as I can remember them.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1850, the &ldquo;Asp&rdquo; was given me by
the Admiralty as a surveying vessel. On taking possession of her, the
Superintendent of the Dockyard, where she lay<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e4703" title="Not in source">,</span> remarked to me<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e4706" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Do you
know, Sir, your ship is said to be haunted, and I don&rsquo;t know if
you will get any of the Dockyard men to work on her.&rdquo; I, of
course, smiled, and I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for ghosts, and
dare say I shall get her all to lights fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">I engaged the shipwrights to do the necessary repairs to
the vessel, but before they had been working in her a week they came to
me in a body and begged me to give the vessel up as she was haunted and
could never bring anything but ill-luck. However, the vessel was at
length repaired, and arrived in safety in the river Dee, where she was
to commence her labours. After my tea in the evening, I generally sat
in my cabin and either read to myself or had an officer of mine (who is
now master of the &lsquo;Magician&rsquo;) to read aloud to me: on such
occasions we used frequently to be interrupted by strange noises, often
such as would be caused by a drunken man or a person staggering about,
which appeared to issue from the after (or ladies&rsquo;) cabin.</p>
<p class="par">The two cabins were only separated from each other by
the companion ladder, the doors faced each other, so that from my cabin
I could see into the after one. There was no communication between
either of them and the other parts of the ship, excepting by the
companion ladder, which no one could ascend or descend without being
seen from my cabin. The evening shortly after our arrival in the Dee,
the officer I mentioned was reading to me in my cabin when all at once
his voice was drowned by a violent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170"
href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>and prolonged noise in the
aft cabin. Thinking it must be the steward he called out
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a noise, steward,&rdquo; and the noise
ceased. When he began to read again the noise also recommenced.
&ldquo;What are you doing, steward&mdash;making such a&mdash;noise
for?&rdquo; he cried out, and taking the candle rushes into the next
cabin. But he came back quicker than he went, saying there was
<span class="corr" id="xd24e4715" title="Source: noboby">nobody</span>
there.</p>
<p class="par">He recommenced reading, and once more began the
mysterious noise. I felt sure there was some drunken person there whom
my officer had overlooked, and accordingly rose and looked myself, and
to my very disagreeable surprise found the cabin empty!</p>
<p class="par">After this evening, the noises became very frequent,
varying in kind and in degree. Sometimes it was as though the seats and
lockers were being banged about, sometimes it sounded as though
decanters and tumblers were being clashed together. During these
disturbances the vessel was lying more than a mile off shore.</p>
<p class="par">One evening I and the above-named officer went to drink
tea at a friend&rsquo;s house at Queen&rsquo;s Ferry, near Chester, the
vessel at the time being lashed to the lower stage opposite
Church&rsquo;s Quay. We returned on board together about 10 p.m. While
descending the companion ladder, I distinctly heard someone rush from
the after cabin into the fore cabin. I stopped the officer who was
behind me at the top of the ladder and whispered to him<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e4724" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Stand
still, I think I have caught the ghost.&rdquo; I then descended into my
cabin, took my sword, which always hung over my bed, and placed it
drawn in his hand saying &ldquo;Now &mdash;&mdash;, allow no one to
pass you; if anyone attempts to escape cut him down, I will stand the
consequences. T then returned to the cabin, struck a light and searched
everywhere, but nothing could I find to account for the noises I had
heard, though I declare solemnly that never did I feel more certain of
anything in my life than that I should find a man there. So there was
nothing to be done but to repeat for the hundredth time<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e4727" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Well, it is
the ghost again!&rdquo; Often when lying in my bed at night have I
heard noises close to me as though my drawers were being opened and
shut, the top of my washing stand raised and banged down again, and a
bed which stood on the opposite side of my cabin, pulled about; while
of an evening I often heard while sitting in my cabin a noise as though
a percussion cap were snapped close to my head; also very often (and I
say it with godly and reverential fear) I have been sensible of the
presence of something invisible about me, and could have put my hand,
so to say, on it, or the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>spot where I felt it was; and all
this occurred, strange to say, without my feeling in the least alarmed
or caring about it, except so far that I could not understand or
account for what I felt and heard.</p>
<p class="par">One night, when the vessel was at anchor in Martyn Roads
I was awoke by the quartermaster calling me and begging me to come on
deck as the look-out man had rushed to the lower deck, saying that a
figure of a lady was standing on the paddle box pointing with her
finger to Heaven. Feeling angry, I told him to send the look-out man on
deck again and keep him there till daybreak, but in attempting to carry
my orders into execution the man went into violent convulsions, and the
result was I had to go myself upon deck and remain there till
morning.</p>
<p class="par">This apparition was often seen after this, and always as
described with her finger pointing towards Heaven.</p>
<p class="par">One Sunday afternoon while lying in the Haverfordwest
river opposite to Lawrenny, the crew being all on shore, and I being at
church, my steward (the only man on board) whilst descending the
companion ladder was spoken to by an unseen voice. He immediately fell
down with fright, and I found his appearance so altered that I really
scarcely knew him! He begged to be allowed his discharge and to be
landed as soon as possible, to which I felt obliged to consent as he
could not be persuaded to remain on board for the night. The story of
the ship being haunted becoming known on shore, the clergyman of
Lawrenny called on me one day and begged me to allow him to question
the crew, which he accordingly did. He seemed very much impressed by
what he heard; he seemed to view the matter in a serious light and said
that his opinion was that &ldquo;some troubled spirit must be lingering
about the vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">During the years that I commanded the &ldquo;Asp&rdquo;
I lost many of my men who ran away on being refused their discharge,
and a great many others I felt forced to let go, so great was their
fear, one and all telling me the same tale, namely, that at night they
saw the transparent figure of a lady pointing with her finger up to
Heaven. For many years I endeavoured to ridicule the affair as I was
often put to considerable inconvenience by the loss of hands, but to no
purpose. I believe that when the officers went out of the vessel after
dark none of the crew would have ventured into the cabin on any
account. One night I was awoke from my sleep by a hand, to all
sensations, being placed on my leg outside the bedclothes. I lay still
for a moment to satisfy myself of the truth of what I felt, and then
grabbed at it, but caught nothing. I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>rang my bell for the
quartermaster to come with his lantern, but found nothing. This
occurred to me several times, but on one occasion as I lay wide awake a
hand was placed on my forehead. If ever a man&rsquo;s hair stood on end
mine did then. I sprang clean out of bed: there was not a sound. Until
then I had never felt the least fear of the ghost or whatever you like
to call it. In fact I had taken a kind of pleasure in listening to the
various noises as I lay in bed, and sometimes when the noises were very
loud I would suddenly pull my bell for the look-out man and then listen
attentively if I could hear the sound of a footstep or attempt to
escape, but there never was any, and I would hear the look-out man walk
from his post to my cabin when I would merely ask him some questions as
to the wind and weather. At length in 1857, the vessel requiring
repairs, was ordered alongside the dockyard wall at Pembroke. The first
night the sentry stationed near the ship saw (as he afterwards
declared) a lady mount the paddle box holding up her hand towards
Heaven. She then stepped on shore and came along the path towards him
when he brought his musket to the charge &ldquo;who goes there?&rdquo;
But the figure walked through the musket, upon which he dropped it and
ran for the guard house. The next sentry saw all this take place and
fired off his gun to alarm the guard. The figure then glided past a
third sentry who was placed near the ruins of Pater old Church, and who
watched her, or it, mount the top of a grave in the old churchyard,
point with her finger to Heaven, and then stand till she vanished from
his sight. The sergeant of the guard came with rank and file to learn
the tale, and the fright of the sentries all along the Dockyard wall
was so great that none would remain at their post unless they were
doubled, which they were, as may be seen by the &ldquo;Report of
guard&rdquo; for that night. Singularly enough, since that, the ghost
has never been heard of again on board the Asp, and I never heard the
noises which before had so incessantly annoyed me. The only clue I
could ever find to account for my vessel being haunted is as
follows:&mdash;Some years previously to my having her, the
&ldquo;Asp&rdquo; had been engaged as a mail packet between Port
Patrick and Donaghadee. After one of her trips, the passengers having
all disembarked, the stewardess on going into the ladies&rsquo; cabin
found a beautiful girl with her throat cut lying in one of the sleeping
berths quite dead! How she came by her death no one could tell and,
though, of course, strict investigations were commenced, neither who
she was or where she came from or anything about her was ever
discovered. The circumstances gave rise to much talk, and the vessel
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>remanded by the authorities, and she was not
again used until handed over to me for surveying service. Here end my
tale, which I have given in all truth. Much as I know one gets laughed
at for believing in ghost stories you are welcome to make what use you
please with this true account of the apparition on board the
&ldquo;Asp.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">A SPIRIT ON HORSEBACK.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Rhosmeherin, in the neighbourhood of Ystrad
Meurig, in Cardiganshire, was formerly well known for its ghost. An old
man named John Jones, who lives at Pontrhydfendigaid, informed me that
when a boy he heard of many belated persons who were terrified in
passing the haunted spot by seeing a ghost which appeared sometimes in
the shape of a cat, at other times as a man on horseback.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Jones also added that a poor old woman had been
murdered there in the old times, which was supposed to account for the
spot being haunted. I have heard several ghost stories in connection
with this spot, but the best is the one which appeared in an
interesting Welsh book entitled, &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Ystraeon y
Gwyll</span>,&rdquo; written by the late Mr. D. Lledrod Davies, a
promising young man, and a candidate for Holy Orders, who died 20 years
ago. Mr. Davies obtained the story from a person who had seen the
ghost; so I give a translation of the Belated&rsquo;s own
words:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was going home one evening from my work from
Ros y Wlad, and had to go through <span class="corr" id="xd24e4758"
title="Source: Rosmeherin">Rhosmeherin</span>. &ldquo;That place, you
know is a terrible spot for its ghosts. People say that they are seen
there in broad daylight. As to myself I did not see them in the
daytime, but many a time was I kept there all night by
Jack-a-Lantern.</p>
<p class="par">I saw a ghost in the form of a cat there also, and when
I began to strike him he disappeared in a blazing fire. But now for the
gentleman. I was near the spot where I had seen the cat, when I heard
the sound of a horse coming after me. I jumped one side to make room
for him to pass; but when he came opposite me he did not go forward a
single pace faster than myself. When I went on slowly, he went slowly;
when I went fast, he went fast. &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said I at
last, but no answer. Then I said it was a very fine night, but the
gentleman on horseback did not seem to take any notice of what I said.
Then thinking that he might be an Englishman (the man was speaking in
Welsh), I said in English &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; but he took no
notice of me still.</p>
<p class="par">By this I was beginning to perspire and almost ready to
fall down with fright, hoping to get rid of him, as I now perceived
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>he was the Devil himself appearing in the form
of a gentleman. I could think from the sound of the saddle and the
shining stirrups that the saddle was a new one. On we went along the
dark narrow lane till we came to the turnpike road, when it became a
little lighter, which gave me courage to turn my eyes to see what kind
of a man he was. The horse looked like a soldier&rsquo;s horse, a
splendid one, and his feet like the feet of a calf, without any shoes
under them, and the feet of the gentleman in the stirrups were also
like the feet of a calf. My courage failed me to look what his head and
body were like. On we went till we came to the cross-road. I had heard
many a time that a ghost leaves everybody there. Well, to the cross
road we came. But ah! I heard the sound of the ground as if it were
going to rend, and the heavens going to fall upon my head; and in this
sound I lost sight of him (the Spirit). How he went away I know not,
nor the direction he went.&rdquo;</p>

that degree that the light of the candle was swallowed up by a greater

was immersed in the heavenly disposition, and he fell down to thank and

<p class="par first">The parish church of Llanfihangel Geneu&rsquo;r
Glyn, is situated about five miles north of Aberystwyth, and it is seen
from the train. About a mile from the church and the village, there is
a respectable farm house, named Glanfread, or Glanfread-fawr which
belongs to the Gogerddan Estate. It is evident that Glanfread was a
place of importance once, and long ago gentry lived there, and it was
the birthplace of Edward Llwyd, the author of Arch&aelig;oligia
Britanica. It is also believed that the house received its name from
St. Fraed, a devout woman who, according to local tradition, came over
from Ireland to build a church on the spot.</p>
<p class="par">There is a legend still extant in the neighbourhood that
when the work of erecting the church on the spot was actually
commenced, the portion built during the day was pulled down during each
night. At last a voice from the spirit world was heard to speak as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<p class="line">Llanfihangel at Genau&rsquo;r Glyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par first">What the spirit meant by these words was that the
church was to be built at Genau&rsquo;r Glyn, and that Glanfread-fawr
farm or mansion was to occupy the spot they were then trying to build
the church; and in accordance with the Spirit&rsquo;s direction the
church was after this built where it now stands instead of at
Glanfread.</p>
<p class="par">The above tradition was related to me by Lady
Hills-Johnes, of Dolaucothy, an intelligent lady who has been a friend
to me for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>nearly twenty years. The late Bishop Thirwall
wanted Lady Hills-Johnes to write a book on the Legends of Wales.</p>
<p class="par">Llanfihangel, of course, is the Welsh for St. Michael,
or rather Michael&rsquo;s Church; but as the early Welsh Christians
generally dedicated their churches to Welsh Saints, it seems probable
that the ancient name of this church was Llanfread; and the name of the
farm Glanfread, where it was first intended to build the church seems
to suggest this. Perhaps the church was re-dedicated to St. Michael by
the Normans, for we know that William the Conqueror seized some lands
in the neighbourhood, and that particular part of the parish is known
to this day as &ldquo;Cyfoeth y Brenin,&rdquo; (the King&rsquo;s
wealth).</p>
<p class="par">St. Michael was a favourite patron of churches with the
Normans, as it was believed that an apparition of the Archangel had
been seen by Aubert, Bishop of Avranches, directing him to build a
church on Mount St. Michael in Normandy.</p>

<p class="par first">From a paper read before the Cardiganshire
Antiquarian Society, by the Rev. J. Morris, Vicar of Llanybyther, I
find that there is a tradition still extant that Llanwenog Church was
also removed by supernatural agency from one site to another.</p>
<p class="par">These popular legends are, undoubtedly, very old, and
are current not only in Wales, but in parts of Scotland also as the
following from Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s Notes to the Lay of the Last
Minstrel prove:</p>
<p class="par">&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;When the workmen were engaged in
erecting the ancient church of Old Deer, in Aberdeenshire, upon a small
hill called Bissau they were surprised to find that the work was
impeded by supernatural obstacles. At length the Spirit of the River
was heard to say:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It is not here, it is not here,</p>
<p class="line">That ye shall build the church of Deer;</p>
<p class="line">But on Taptillery,</p>
<p class="line">Where many a corpse shall lie.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">&ldquo;The site of the edifice was accordingly
transferred to Taptillery, an eminence at some distance from where the
building had been commenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As to the origin of these legends or traditions of the
mysterious removal of churches, it is not easy to arrive at a correct
explanation. Some writers are of the opinion that they contain a
record, imaginative and exaggerated, of real incidents connected with
the history of the churches to which each of them belongs, and that
they are in most cases reminiscences of an older church which once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>actually stood on another site. Others see in
these stories traces of the antagonism, in remote times, between
peoples holding different religious beliefs, and the steps taken by one
party to seize and appropriate the sacred spots of the other.</p>
<p class="par">That some of these tales have had their origin in
primitive times, even anterior to Christianity, is probable.</p>

Llandyssul in Cardiganshire, which was only about two miles from
Pentre-Cwrt, he met with a cobbler who carried a very large bundle of
old shoes. After saluting the devil the cobbler asked him to where did
he intend taking the shovelful of mound? &ldquo;To the mouth of
Alltcafan,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo; asked
the cobbler again. &ldquo;To dam the River Teivy so as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>to
drown the people of Pentre-Cwrt,&rdquo; said the devil. Now the cobbler
was a very shrewd man, and in order to frustrate the evil design of the
Old Gentleman, he told him that the place where he intended to dam the
river was very far away. &ldquo;How far is it?&rdquo; asked the devil.
&ldquo;I cannot tell you the exact distance,&rdquo; replied the
cobbler, &ldquo;but in walking from there I have worn out all these
shoes<span class="corr" id="xd24e4945" title=

devil, &ldquo;it is too far, for I am already tired,&rdquo; and down
did he throw the shovelful of mould, and the shovelful which the devil
threw down is to be seen to this day, and known as Cnwc
Coedfoel.&mdash;See Hanes Plwyf Llangeler, gan D. Jones.</p>

tried to set his mastiff on; the huge beast crouched, frightened by his

master boldly stooped to pick up a stone thinking that would frighten
the evil dog; but suddenly a circle of fire surrounded it, which
lighting up the gloom, showed the white snip down to the dog&rsquo;s
nose, and his grinning teeth, and white tail. He then knew it was one

First seizing the keys from the person to whom they were entrusted, he
impudently assumed the steward&rsquo;s office, which he managed so
prudently and providently, that all things seemed to abound under his
care, and there was no deficiency in the house. Whatever the master or
mistress secretly thought of having for their daily use or provision,
he procured with wonderful agility, and without any previous
directions, saying, &ldquo;You wished that to be done, and it shall be
done for you.&rdquo; He was also well acquainted with their treasures
and secret hoards, and sometimes upbraided them on that account; for as
often as they seemed to act sparingly and avariciously, he used to say,
&ldquo;Why are you afraid to spend that heap of gold or silver, since
your lives are of so short duration, and the money you so cautiously
hoard up will never do you any service?&rdquo; He gave the choicest
meat and drink to the rustics and hired servants, saying that
&ldquo;Those persons should be abundantly supplied, by whose labours
they were acquired.&rdquo; Whatever he determined should be done,
whether pleasing or displeasing to his master or mistress (for, as we
have said before, he knew all their secrets), he completed in his usual
expeditious manner, without their consent. He never went to church or
uttered one catholic word. He did not sleep in the house, but was ready
at his office in the morning. He was at length observed by some of the
family to hold his nightly converse near a mill and a pool of water;
upon which discovery, he was summoned the next morning before the
master of the house and his lady, and, receiving his discharge,
delivered up the keys, which he had held for upwards of forty days.
Being earnestly interrogated, at his departure who he was? he answered,

<p class="par first">For the following tale I am indebted to Mr. T. C.
Evans (Cadrawd) the eminent antiquarian and folk-lorist of
Llangynwyd:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Once upon a time there lived a fair and gentle
maiden in the neighbourhood of the Demon&rsquo;s Rock, who often
wandered out in the sunset and balmy summer evenings to meet her lover,
and would return with her countenance radiant with joy, and the bright
light of inexpressible rapture beaming in her love-lighted eye. Evening
after evening would she stray out alone to the trysting place to meet
her lover, and seemed as happy as a bird that warbles its morning song
when the early sun gladdens the earth. However, it chanced that one of
her companions followed her one moonlight night&mdash;saw the maiden go
to a widespreading oak, and heard the whispering soft and low. She was
surprised that she could not observe anyone, neither could she hear any
reply to the maiden&rsquo;s sweet and loving voice. Affrighted, she
hastened back and said that a mysterious dread had crept over her while
listening and watching her companion; they kept it secret, but
questioned the maiden on her return. She said that her lover was a
gentleman, and that she had promised to meet him the next evening in
the same spot. The next evening they followed her again and saw her
addressing the empty air&mdash;they felt assured now that it must be
the Spirit of Darkness that was tempting the girl. Her companions
warned her and told her how she had been watched, and that they could
not see who or whom she spoke to.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e5017" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>She became alarmed, but yet could not
refrain from meeting her lover, (as she supposed), once again, as she
had made a vow and bound herself by a solemn promise to meet him in
this valley in the dead hour of the night. She was also bound to go
alone. It was a fearful trial. The night came, the moon hid itself, and
dark clouds swept <span class="corr" id="xd24e5020" title=
"Source: hurredly">hurriedly</span> across the sky. With blanched
cheeks and trembling steps the maiden approached the appointed place.
She held (firmly grasped) in her hand a Bible, and as the traitor
approached, a straggling gleam of moonshine revealed his form; and oh!
horrible to relate, she saw the cloven hoof! With one long piercing cry
for protection from heaven she fled; at the same instant the valley was
filled with wild unearthly shrieks. The roar of the deafening thunder
shook the hills to their foundations; wild and blinding lightnings,
together with yells and howls from the legions of baffled fiends rushed
by on the startled air. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=

torrent that swept all before it. In the morning a strange scene of
devastation presented itself, and the woods seemed crumbled up; the
valley was a chaotic mass of confusion, while in the centre of the
hamlet was this huge stone which they say the vengeful demon tore from
its firm bed on the hillside, and flung at the flying maiden as she
evaded his grasp. It remains in the spot where it was cast, and is
known as the Demon&rsquo;s Rock.&rdquo;</p>

GENTLEMAN<span class="corr" id="xd24e5033" title=

TRAVELLED ON SUNDAY.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The late Rev. Elias Owen, &ldquo;Welsh
Folk-Lore,&rdquo; page 152, Vicar of Llanyblodwel, received the
following tale from his deceased friend, the Rev. J. L. Davies, late
Rector of Llangynog, who had obtained it from William Davies, the man
who figures in the story:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;William Davies, Penrhiw, near Aberystwyth, went
to England for the harvest, and after having worked there about three
weeks, he returned home alone, with all possible haste, as he knew that
his father-in-law&rsquo;s fields were by this time ripe for the sickle.
He, however, failed to accomplish the journey before Sunday; but he
determined to travel on Sunday, and thus reached home on Sunday night
to be ready to commence reaping on Monday morning. His conscience,
though, would not allow him to be at rest, but he endeavoured to
silence its twittings by saying to himself that he had with him no
clothes to go to a place of worship. He stealthily, therefore, walked
on, feeling very guilty every step he took, and dreading to meet anyone
going to Chapel or Church. By Sunday evening he had reached the hill
overlooking Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn, where he was known, so he
determined not to enter the village until after the people had gone to
their respective places of worship; he therefore sat down on the hill
side and contemplated the scene below.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e5041" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>He saw the people leave their houses for
the House of God, he heard their songs of praise, and now he thinks he
could venture to descend and pass through the village unobserved.
Luckily, no one saw him going through the village, and now he has
entered a barley field, and although still uneasy in mind, he feels
somewhat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>reassured, and steps on quickly. He had not
proceeded far in the barley field before he found himself surrounded by
a large number of small pigs. He was not much struck by this, though he
thought it strange that so many pigs should be allowed to wander about
on the Sabbath Day. The pigs, however, came up to him, grunted and
scampered away. Before he had traversed the barley field he saw
approaching him an innumerable number of mice, and these, too,
surrounded him, only, however, to stare at him, and then disappear. By
this Davies began to be frightened, and he was almost sorry that he had
broken the Sabbath Day by travelling with his pack on his back instead
of keeping the day holy. He was not now very far from home, and this
thought gave him courage and on he went. He had not proceeded any great
distance from the spot where the mice had appeared when he saw a large
grey-hound walking before him on the pathway. He anxiously watched the
dog, but suddenly it vanished out of sight.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e5047" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>By this, the poor man was thoroughly
frightened, and many and truly sincere were his regrets that he had
broken the Sabbath; but on he went. He passed through the village of
Llanilar without any further fright. He had now gone about three miles
from Llanfihangel along the road that goes to Aberystwyth, and he had
begun to dispel the fear that had seized him, but to his horror he saw
something approach him that made his hair stand on end. He could not at
first make it out, but he soon clearly saw that it was a horse that was
madly dashing towards him. He had only just time to step on to the
ditch, when, horrible to relate, a headless white horse rushed passed
him.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e5051" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>His limbs shook and the perspiration
stood out like beads on bis forehead. This terrible spectre he saw when
close to Tan&rsquo;rallt, but he dared not turn into the house, as he
was travelling on Sunday, so on he went again, and heartily did he wish
himself at home. In fear and dread he proceeded on his journey towards
Penrhiw. The most direct way from Tan&rsquo;rallt to Penrhiw was a
pathway through the fields, and Davies took this pathway, and now he
was in sight of his home, and he hastened towards the boundary fence
between Tan&rsquo;rallt and Penrhiw. He knew that there was a gap in
the hedge that he could get through, and for this gap he aimed; he
reached it, but further progress was impossible, for in the gap was a
lady lying at full length, and immovable, and stopping up the gap
entirely. Poor Davies was now more terrified than ever. He sprang
aside, he screamed and then fainted right away. As soon as he recovered
consciousness, he, on his knees, and in a loud <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=

"Source: suplicating">supplicating</span> voice, prayed for pardon. His
mother and father-in-law heard him, and the mother knew the voice and
said, &ldquo;It is my Will! some mishap has overtaken him.&rdquo; They
went to him and found he was so weak that he could not move, and they
were obliged to carry him home, where he recounted to them his
marvellous experience. The late Rector of Llangynog, who was intimately
acquainted with William Davies, had many conversations with him about
his Sunday journey, and he argued the matter with him, and tried to
persuade him that he had seen nothing, but that it was his imagination
working on a nervous temperament that had created all his fantasies.
He, however, failed to convince him, for Davies affirmed that it was no
hallucination, but that what he had seen that Sunday was a punishment
for his having broken the Fourth Commandment.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE DEVIL AND LLANARTH CHURCH.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A writer in the Arch. Cam., 1850, page 73,
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">In the Churchyard of Llanarth, near Aberaeron, on the
South side of the Church, there is an inscribed stone (not hitherto
published) of the twelfth century. It bears a cross covering the stone
with four circular holes at the junction of the arms. The inscription
is on the lower limb of the cross; but as it is made of a micaceous
sandstone, part has been split off, and the inscription is much
mutilated.... The current tradition of the place concerning it is, that
one stormy night, some centuries ago, there was such a tremendous
shindy going on up in the <span class="corr" id="xd24e5069" title=
"Source: belfrey">belfry</span> that the whole village was put in
commotion. It was conjectured that nobody but a certain ancient
personage could be the cause of this, and, therefore, they fetched up
his reverence from the vicarage to go and request the intruder to be
off. Up went the vicar with bell, book and candle, along the narrow
winding staircase, and, sure enough, right up aloft among the bells
there was his majesty in person! No sooner, however, had the worthy
priest began the usual &lsquo;conjurate in nomine, etc.&rsquo; than
away went the enemy up the remaining part of the staircase on to the
leads of the tower. The Vicar, nothing daunted, followed, and pressed
the intruder so briskly that the latter had nothing else to do than to
leap over the battlements. He came down plump among the gravestones
below; and, falling upon one, made with his hands and knees the four
holes now visible on the stone in question.</p>
<p class="par">Another writer in &ldquo;Y Brython&rdquo; for 1859,
says, that the Devil&rsquo;s purpose in troubling Llanarth Church was
to rob it of one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span>of its bells and carry it to Llanbadarn
Fawr Church, near Aberystwyth, twenty miles distant, as the latter,
though once a cathedral, had only two bells, whilst the former, only a
parish church, had four. And an old story still lingers in the
neighbourhood of Llanarth that the Devil whilst thus engaged in
carrying the bell, put it down and rested and re-arranged his heavy
load at the very commencement of his journey, and a particular spot
between the church and the river on a road known as &ldquo;Rhiw
Cyrff,&rdquo; is pointed out as the place where the D&mdash;&mdash;l
put down the bell. Moreover, it is added that from that day forth, the
sound of Llanarth bells cannot be heard from that spot, though it is
only a few yards from the church tower.</p>
<p class="par">The Llanarth legend is the only story in Wales that I
know of in which the Spirit of darkness carries a church bell, as it
was believed in old times that the Evil One was afraid of bells, and
fled away at the sound of them.</p>
<p class="par">There are, however, traditions of churches troubled by
the Devil in other parts of Wales besides Llanarth, and in the old
superstitious times the north door of a church was called
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Door.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was thought that as the priest entered the church
through the south door, the Evil Spirit was obliged to make his exit
through the north door.</p>
<p class="par">It might also be added that in former times no one was
buried on the north side of a churchyard, as it was known as the
&ldquo;Domain of Demons.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">HOW TO GET RID OF GHOSTS, SPIRITS, GOBLINS, AND
DEVILS, ETC.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In some parts, especially on the borders of
Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, it is believed that any one carrying
a knife in his hands, will never see or be troubled by a spirit, even
when passing a haunted spot in the depth of night.</p>
<p class="par">When staying for a short time in the parish of
Llandyssul about five years ago, I was told that there lived a few
years ago a certain man in the village of Pontshan in that parish, who,
when coming home late one night, saw a ghost on the roadside whilst
passing a well-known haunted spot in the neighbourhood. The man took
out his knife from his pocket, and the ghost vanished. After this,
whenever he passed a haunted place the man held a knife in his hand,
and never saw a ghost again. In South Pembrokeshire, a V-shaped twig of
the mountain ash was considered a protective against spirits.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It was also believed once in all parts of Wales that to
wear body-linen inside out, and to nail a horseshoe against the door
kept away both evil spirits and witches. Even in the present day people
all over the world think that there is some &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; in
finding a horseshoe, and to a young girl it means a new lover.</p>
<p class="par">When a spirit troubled a house in Wales, it was
sometimes customary to call together the most godly persons in the
parish to hold a prayer-meeting; at other times a conjurer, or a priest
was sent for, for it was formerly thought that a clergyman had the
power to &ldquo;lay&rdquo; or exorcise spirits. There were particular
forms of exorcising. When the Devil was in the belfry of Llanarth
Church, Cardiganshire, the Vicar went to drive away the Evil One, with

<p class="par">Until the time of Henry VIII., it seems that it was
customary to curse mortals, as well as to exorcise fiends &ldquo;with
bell, book and candle&rdquo;; for in an old book called
&ldquo;Dugdale&rsquo;s Baronage,&rdquo; published in 1675, it is said
that in the 37th. year of Henry III., &ldquo;a Curse was denounced in
Westminster Hall against the violation of Magna Charta, with bell, book
and candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And in Fox&rsquo;s account of the ceremony of
excommunication, we are told that three candles were carried before the
clergy, and that as each candle was extinguished prayer was made that
the souls of malefactors and schismatics might be &ldquo;given over
utterly to the power of the fiend as this candle is now quenched and
put out.&rdquo;</p>

in North Cardiganshire. The late Mr. John Jones, Bristol House,
informed me that there was a spirit there once troubling the family,
and the servants, and especially the head servant who had no peace as
the ghost followed the poor man everywhere whenever he went out at
night, and often threw water into his face. At last the servant went to
a wise man or a conjurer. The Conjurer came with him to Penpompren Plas
to &ldquo;lay&rdquo; the Spirit, and transformed it into an insect, in
a bottle, which was securely corked. Then the bottle was thrown under
the river bridge close by.</p>
<p class="par">There are many such stories in different parts of the
country; and it is said that under the Monument Arch of Old
Haverfordwest Bridge in Pembrokeshire, a spirit has been laid for a
thousand years, and that at the expiration of that time it will again
be free to roam the earth to trouble people.</p>

at the time, but he came home occasionally to spend his holidays with
his wife, especially about Christmas time.</p>
<p class="par">On one occasion, however, when Shan expected her husband
home the day before Christmas as usual, Shon came not. Nine

him and to prevent him spending his money on beer at a public house
which his friend, a saddler kept at Tyngraig. But her husband was not
at the public house, nor was he seen anywhere, so the old woman had to
return home in disappointment. It was a cloudless moonlight night,
almost as light as day, but the road was lonely and the hour late, and
when she had walked some distance, to her great terror, she noticed a
ghost in the field making his way nearer and nearer to her till at last
the strange object came to the hedge on the roadside quite close to

most important of the superstitions of Wales are the death portents and
omens; and this is perhaps more or less true of every country. About a
generation or two ago, there were to be found almost in every parish
some old people who could tell before hand when a death was going to
lake place; and even in the present day we hear of an old man or an old
woman, here and there, possessing, or supposed to possess, an insight
of this kind into the future.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Lloyd, Ffynnonddagrau, Llangynog, Carmarthenshire,
told me five years ago that there lived at Ffynnonddagrau, an old man
named Thomas Harries, who always foretold every death in the parish as
he possessed second sight. John Thomas, Pentre, who worked about the
farms, called with my informant one day on his way home; he was in good
health then, but on the very next day he was very ill and soon died.
Harries had foretold the death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"

before he was taken ill. He had also foretold the death of one Howells,

of Moelfre Fach, as well as the death of one Thomas Thomas about 35
years ago. People were almost frightened to see Harries as he so often
foretold the death of someone or other, and his predictions were always
correct. My informant also added that Harries only died about 20 years

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A young man who lives in the Gwaun Valley, between
Pontfaen and Fishguard informed me in the beginning of November, 1905,
that he had just seen a phantom or a spirit funeral only a few weeks
previously.</p>
<p class="par">A friend of his, a young porter at a Railway Station in
the neighbourhood of Cardiff, had come home ill to his native place in
Pembrokeshire, and his friend, my informant, one night sat up by his
bedside all night. About three o&rsquo;clock in the morning the patient
was so seriously ill that my informant in alarm hurried to call the
father of the poor sufferer to come to see him, as the old man lived in
a small cottage close by. As soon as he went out through the door into
the open air, to his great astonishment he found himself in a large
crowd of people, and there was a coffin resting on some chairs, ready
to be placed on the bier; and the whole scene, as it were, presented a
funeral procession, ready to convey the dead to the grave. When the
young man attempted to proceed on his way, the procession also
proceeded, or moved on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>in the same direction, so that he
found himself still in the crowd. After going on in this manner for
about a hundred yards, he managed to draw one side from the crowd and
soon reached the house of his sick friend&rsquo;s father, and nearly
fainted. Three days after this vision the seer&rsquo;s friend died; and
on the day of the funeral the young man noticed that the crowd stood in
front of the house and the coffin resting on chairs exactly as he had
seen in the apparition. I may add that my informant who had seen the
phantom funeral was so terrified even at the time when I saw him, that
he was too much afraid to go out at night. It so happened that I was
staying in that part of Pembrokeshire at the time, so I went to see the
man myself, and a clergyman accompanied me.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Though more than thirty years have run their
course since the incident which is to be described here occurred, still
the impression which it left on the writer&rsquo;s mind was so vivid
and lasting that he finds not the slightest difficulty in recalling its
minutest details at the present moment. Some experiences are so
impressive that time itself seems powerless to efface them from the
memory, and of such the following appears to be an instance:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">It happened in the early Spring, just when the days were
perceptibly lengthening, and a balmy feeling was creeping into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>air, and a glad sense of hope was throbbing
throughout the whole of nature. A boy of ten, or may be a couple of
years younger, tired out after a hard day of play and pleasure, sat
resting on a log near a lonely house, in a sparsely populated district.
As he sat, he gazed down a long stretch of white and dusty road leading
away past the house. As a rule, few and far between would be the
travellers who used that unfrequented road. The sole exception would be
on a Sunday, when perhaps a dozen or more of the neighbours might be
seen wending their way, to or from the nearest place of worship.
Intense, therefore, was the boy&rsquo;s surprise, when on this
week-day, his eyes discerned a goodly company turning the corner in the
distance, and proceeding in an orderly procession along the stretch of
straight road which his vantage ground commanded. He watched it keenly,
and wondered greatly. Never had he before seen such a crowd on that
particular road. As the people drew nearer and nearer, something of
solemnity in their orderly and silent manner struck on the
watcher&rsquo;s imagination, but no sense of anything akin to the
supernatural obsessed his mind for a second, still he failed not to
mark, that for so large an assemblage, it was remarkably noiseless.
Twenty yards, more or less, from where the youthful watcher sat, a
footpath leading over a piece of wet and barren land joined the road.
This path, which could be traversed only in dry weather, terminated
half a mile away, at the door of a solitary cottage inhabited by a farm
hand named Williams, who dwelt there with his wife and several young
children. When the crowd arrived at the spot where the path ran on to
the road, there seemed to be a momentary hesitation, and then the
procession left the road and took to the footpath. The watcher strained
every nerve, in an effort to recognise some one or other in the crowd,
but though there was something strangely familiar about it all, there
was also something so dim and shadowy, as to preclude the possibility
of knowing anyone with certainty; but as the tail end of the procession
curved round to gain the path, something he did observe, which caused a
thrill, for the last four men carried high on their shoulders a
bier,&mdash;but it was an empty bier. Soon as the multitude was out of
sight, the boy rushed to the house, and related his curious experience.
No thought of anything weird and uncanny had so far crossed his mind,
and his one desire at the time was to gain some information as to where
the people were bound for. Neither could he just then understand the
manifest consternation, and the hushed awe, which fell upon his hearers
as he unfolded his tale. Amongst these there happened to be a visitor,
an old dame of a class well known in many parts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of
rural Wales in those days. It was her habit to stroll from farm to farm
along the country side, regaling the housewives with the latest gossip.
In return she would be sure of a meal, and also something to carry home
in her wallet. Naturally, such a character would be shrewd and keen,
knowing well not only what tales would suit her company, but also the
truth, or otherwise, of any tales which she herself might be a listener
to. In addition, the old dame in question was generally supposed to be
immune from all fear, and cared not how far from home she might be when
the shades of night overtook her. On the present occasion, although a
few minutes before, she had been on the point of starting, and was
indeed only waiting to be handed her usual dole of charity, no sooner
had she heard the lad&rsquo;s strange tale, than she flatly declared
that no power on earth could move her to travel an inch further that
evening, and so at the expense of much inconvenience to the household a
bed had to be prepared for her. However, she started early on the
following morning, and long before noon, owing mainly to her assiduous
diligence, the news had travelled far and near, that a phantom funeral
had been seen on the previous evening. Her tale made a deep impression
throughout the country-side. Those prone to superstition,&mdash;and it
must be confessed, they were many,&mdash;lent a ready ear. A
few,&mdash;and these prided themselves on their
commonsense,&mdash;doubted. The latter class were not slow to point
out, what they considered to be, a fatal flaw in the evidence. The
supposed funeral was travelling in a direction, which led away from the
churchyard. Had it been going down the road instead of up, they argued,
that there might be something in it. Then again, it took the footpath,
and it was pointed out, not only that funerals kept to the high roads,
but that this particular path, could not by any stretch of imagination
be said to lead to any burial ground. This seemed a reasonable view to
take, and as one day succeeded another, without anything unusual
happening, the excitement cooled down. However, within a few weeks
Williams, who lived in the cottage across the marsh was taken ill. At
first, it was thought that he had contracted a chill, and it was hoped
that he would soon be well again. The nearest medical man lived six
miles away, and that caused further delay. On the fifth day the doctor
came, but he came to find that it was too late for his skill to be of
any avail. A glance at the patient had satisfied him that it was a case
of double pneumonia, and that the end was rapidly approaching. A few
hours later and Williams had drawn his last breath. Three days more and
the funeral took place. As is the custom in country places, the
neighbours <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>from far and near attended, and on their way a
group of men called at the burial place for the bier. This group was
joined by others so that long before the house of mourning was reached
the procession was a large one. It travelled up the long stretch of
road where the lad had watched that mysterious crowd, in the twilight
six weeks before. The same lad watched again, and when the procession
reached the point, where the footpath branched away across the fields,
the man who acted as leader stopped, and raised his hand, while the
procession hesitated for a moment, then looking at his watch, the
leader spoke in low clear tones, &ldquo;men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it
is already getting late if we go round by the road, it will get very
late; we will take the path.&rdquo; He led the way and as his followers
swept round the curve, the lad saw that the last four men carried on
their shoulders an empty bier. It was being taken to fetch the
body.</p>

Pembrokeshire, informed me that her family possessed the peculiar gift
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=

phantom of her own funeral before she died.</p>
<p class="par">When she was out walking one night, the old woman was
terrified by seeing a funeral procession meeting her on the road and
which passed on towards Caersalem, a Nonconformist Chapel close by. The
Rev. Jenkin Evans, Vicar of Pontfaen, was walking behind the
procession, and she even took notice of his dress and what kind of hat
he had on his head. She was taken ill the very next day, and in a very
short time died, and every one in the neighbourhood believed that she
had seen an apparition of her own funeral. The deceased was buried at
Caersalem; and as her daughter, Martha, was at the time a maid-servant
at Pontfaen Vicarage, the Vicar accompanied the girl to her
mother&rsquo;s funeral in his carriage. When he arrived in the
neighbourhood where the funeral was to take place, he left his horse
and trap at a <span class="corr" id="xd24e5255" title=

mourning on foot, as the distance the funeral procession had to go from
Melin Cilgwm to Caersalem burial place was very short. Strange to say,
when the funeral did proceed, it so happened that the Vicar of Pontfaen
walked behind the procession, and his clothes, and even his very hat
were in exact accordance with the description which had been given by
the dead woman of the vision.</p>

<h3 class="main">A DAY-DREAM.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Another remarkable instance of second-sight seeing
appeared in &ldquo;Notes and Queries&rdquo; for July, 1858. The
contributor, Mr. John Pavin Phillips, gives the following account of
what occurred to him himself in the year 1818, upon his return home to
Pembrokeshire, after many years&rsquo; absence:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A few days after my arrival, I took a walk one
morning in the yard of one of our parish churches, through which there
is a right of way for pedestrians. My object was a twofold one:
Firstly, to enjoy the magnificent prospect visible from that portion;
and secondly, to see whether any of my friends or acquaintances who had
died during my absence were buried in the locality. After gazing around
me for a short time, I sauntered on, looking at one tombstone and then
at another, when my attention was arrested by an altar-tomb enclosed
within an iron railing. I walked up to it and read an inscription which
informed me that it was in memory of Colonel &mdash;&mdash;. This
gentleman had been the assistant Poor Law Commissioner for South Wales,
and while on one of his periodical tours of inspection, he was seized
with apoplexy in the Workhouse of my native town, and died in a few
hours. This was suggested to my mind as I read the inscription on the
tomb, as the melancholy event occurred during the period of my absence,
and I was only made cognisant of the fact through the medium of the
local press. Not being acquainted with the late Colonel &mdash;&mdash;,
and never having seen him, the circumstances of his sudden demise had
long passed from my memory, and were only revived by my thus viewing
his tomb. I then passed on, and shortly afterwards returned home. On my
arrival my father asked me in what direction I had been walking, and I
replied, in &mdash;&mdash; Churchyard, looking at the tombs, and among
others I have seen the tomb of Col. &mdash;&mdash;, who died in the
Workhouse. &lsquo;That&rsquo; replied my father &lsquo;is impossible,
as there is no tomb erected over Colonel &mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s
grave.&rsquo; At this remark I laughed. &lsquo;My dear father,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;You want to persuade me that I cannot read. I was not
aware that Colonel &mdash;&mdash; was buried in the Churchyard, and was
only informed of the fact by reading the inscription on the
tomb.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whatever you may say to the contrary&rsquo; said my
father, &lsquo;What I tell you is true; there is no tomb over Colonel
&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s grave.&rsquo; Astounded by the reiteration of
this statement, as soon as I had dined I returned to the Churchyard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>and again inspected all the tombs having
railings around them, and found that my father was right.</p>
<p class="par">There was not only no tomb bearing the name of Colonel
&mdash;&mdash;, but there was no tomb at all corresponding in
appearance with the one I had seen. Unwilling to credit the evidence of
my own senses, I went to the cottage of an old acquaintance of my
boyhood, who lived outside of the Churchyard gate, and asked her to
show the place where Colonel &mdash;&mdash; lay buried. She took me to
the spot, which was a green mound, undistinguished in appearance from
the surrounding graves.</p>
<p class="par">Nearly two years subsequent to this occurrence,
surviving relatives erected an Altar-tomb, with a railing round it,
over the last resting place of Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, and it was, as
nearly as I could remember, an exact reproducing of the memorial of my
day-dream. Verily, &lsquo;there are more things in Heaven and earth
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CORPSE CANDLE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The &ldquo;Canwyll Corph&rdquo; or Corpse Candle,
was another death portent often seen in West and Mid-Wales, about a
generation or two ago. Indeed there are several persons still alive who
have told me that they had seen this mysterious light themselves. It
was a pale light moving slowly and hovering a short distance from the
ground. Some could tell whether a man, woman, or child was to die. The
death of a man was indicated by a red light, that of a woman by a white
light, and a faint light before the death of a child. If two lights
were seen together, two deaths were to take place in the same house at
the same time. If the light was seen early in the evening a death was
to take place soon, but if late it was not to take place for some
time.</p>
<p class="par">Like the &ldquo;toili&rdquo; or phantom funeral, the
Corpse Candle also was seen going along from the house&mdash;where
death was to take place&mdash;to the churchyard along the same route
which a funeral was to take, whether road or path.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes the light was seen carried by a spectral
representation of the dying person, and it was even thought possible to
recognise that person by standing near the water watching the
apparition crossing over it. Another way of recognising the dying
person was to stand at the church porch watching the candle entering
the building. There are some instances of people seeing their own
corpse candle.</p>
<p class="par">There was an old woman living at Llanddarog, in
Carmarthenshire, named Margaret Thomas, who always saw every light or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=

every funeral. She only died about 27 years ago.</p>
<p class="par">Another old woman who also saw the same death portents
was Mary Thomas, Dafy, who lived close to Llandyssul churchyard in
Cardiganshire. She was buried sixty years ago.</p>
<p class="par">There is a tradition that St. David, by prayer, obtained
the Corpse Candle as a sign to the living of the reality of another
world, and according to some people it was confined to the Diocese of
St. David&rsquo;s, but the fact of it is there are tales of corpse
candles all over Wales.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Owen Evans, Maesydderwen, near Llansawel,
Carmarthenshire, who is over 90 years of age, gave me the following
account of a Corpse Candle which had been seen at Silian, near
Lampeter.</p>
<p class="par">When Evans was a boy, his father lived in an old house
close to the churchyard walls, and kept the key of the church door. At
that time singing practice was often conducted in the church,
especially during the long winter evenings. One evening a certain young
man entered the churchyard with the intention of going to the church to
attend this singing-class, though it was a little too early; but he
could see light in the church through one of the windows. So on he went
to the church door thinking that the singing had commenced, or at least
that some one was in the church. But to his great surprise he found the
door closed and locked, and when he looked in through the key-hole
there was not a soul to be seen inside the church. The young man then
went to the house of Owen Evans&rsquo;s father and informed the old man
that there was light in the church, but that he did not see anyone
inside. &ldquo;You must be making a mistake,&rdquo; said my
informant&rsquo;s father to the young man, &ldquo;there cannot possibly
be any light in the church; no one could have entered the building to
light it, for the door is locked, and I have the key here in the
house.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I am positively certain,&rdquo; said the young
man again, &ldquo;that there is light in the church, for I took
particular notice of it.&rdquo; Both of the two men now went to the
church together, and as they approached, they noticed a light coming
out from the church. This light moved slowly towards a certain part of
the churchyard, and the two men followed it and watched it until it
suddenly disappeared into the ground. That it was a corpse candle they
had no doubt in their minds. The young man had a walking stick in his
hand with which he made a mark or a hole in the ground on the spot
where the light had sunk. Soon after this a death took <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>place in the neighbourhood, and the dead was
buried in the very spot where the corpse candle had sunk into the
ground.</p>
<p class="par">My informant told me also that he had seen a corpse
candle himself before the death of an adopted son of one Mr. John
Evans, who lived at Glandenis, in the same neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="par first">An old man named James, living at Nantgaredig in
Carmarthenshire, gave me an account of how he himself and his father
and others had seen a Corpse Candle in the parish of Conwil Elvet.</p>
<p class="par">When James was a boy, he was sent one day by a
farmer&rsquo;s wife on a message to Llanpumpsaint, about three miles
off, to fetch a pair of clogs from the blacksmith, and a few small
things from a shop in the village. When he arrived there he went first
to the blacksmith, but he had to wait there as the clogs were not
ready. Then he went to the village shop, but, unfortunately, the woman
who kept the shop was not at home, and he had to wait several hours; so
that when he returned to the farm with his message it was quite dark.
But the farmer&rsquo;s wife gave him plenty to eat and a present of a
waistcoat. Then he went home to Nantglas, where his father and mother
lived. It was now getting late in the evening, and he was only a boy
going along a lonely road. When he was between Yetyffin, and Cwmgweren,
he noticed some light coming after him nearer and nearer, and it even
passed him at last. It hovered within about two feet from the ground as
it went slowly along. The boy, who was a little bit frightened, now
knocked at the door of a house he was passing and called the attention
of the inmates to the strange light on the road.</p>
<p class="par">On he went again, and he even passed the light on the
road; but when he reached home and told his parents about it, his
father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>would not believe that he had seen a light. But
the boy opened the door just as the light was passing and he called his
father to come out and see it. The whole family now came out, and both
his father and the other children saw the light, but his mother and one
of the children did not see it&mdash;not possessing second sight.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after this, a child died at a house called
Yet-y-ffin; and my informant&rsquo;s father and his neighbours were
convinced that the light which they had seen was his corpse candle.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes a corpse candle was seen coming into the
chamber of the person about to die.</p>
<p class="par">A woman, who was a native of Gwynfi in Carmarthenshire,
told me about five years ago that when her child was dying, she took
particular notice of a pale bluish light coming in through the window
and standing right over the bed. I have also heard several other
persons saying things of this kind.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following story was contributed to the
&ldquo;Pembrokeshire County Guardian,&rdquo; May 11th., 1901, by Mr.
Joseph Davies, Glynderwen:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It happened not many miles from Tenby where a
certain young school mistress lodged at a farm house where she was very
happy in every respect. One night after retiring to rest, the light
having been put out, and she was lying awake, she suddenly noticed a
peculiar greyish light like a little star moving towards the foot of
her bed from the doorway. The light came to a stand-still by her bed
and gently lowered to her feet. Almost paralysed with fear, she called
with all her strength for help, and in a few minutes the whole of the
household were together in the room listening in amazement to the
frightened girl&rsquo;s story, and all sorts of means were used to
pacify her and to induce her to go to sleep, but without avail. She
would not stay in that room for the world, and her bed had to be
removed and fixed on a temporary bedstead in the room where the
mistress slept. Time passed, and the story spread abroad; some made
light of it, and some looked serious, and all tried to get the young
lady to shake off all thoughts of it. But to no purpose&mdash;let them
laugh or chaff, she bore the same sad expression, and said something
would certainly follow to clear up the mystery. About six weeks or so
had passed, and one night the mistress, who was a strong healthy woman,
suddenly took ill, and quite unexpectedly died. The young
schoolmistress happened at the time to be away on her holidays, and on
hearing of the sad news she hurried back to attend the funeral. When
she arrived at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>the house she was taken upstairs to see the
body, she again became almost paralysed on finding that the corpse had
been laid out on the spare bedstead on the very spot where she had six
weeks previously pointed out where the light had lowered and
disappeared. No one had thought of the incident until reminded of it.
The body had been laid out there for convenience at the time; no one
ever thought of the young lady&rsquo;s fright until she now pointed it
out herself.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e5389" title=

the whole neighbourhood became convinced that there was something in it
after all, and the old superstition got strengthened in the minds of
the young people that it remains to a great extent to the present
time.&rdquo;</p>

coffin-making. An old lady who lives at Pontshan, Llandyssul, told me
three years ago, that when she was a young woman, she and two other
young women were on one occasion sitting near the fire all night
watching and nursing a sick old woman of 80 years of age. About four

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Several old persons living in the parish of
Blaenporth, South Cardiganshire, informed me that it is a fact that in
former times a death in certain families in that parish was always
foretold by the church-bell in the steeple tolling three times at the
hour of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=

gave me the following tradition concerning the origin of this
tolling:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Once upon a time a spirit came at midnight and knocked
at the door of a farmhouse known as Tan-yr-Eglwys, which is close to
Blaenporth Church. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; enquired the farmer from
his bed. &ldquo;Mair Wen (white Mary) of Blaenporth,&rdquo; was the
reply; &ldquo;the silver communion cup has been stolen from the
church.&rdquo; Then the spirit begged the farmer to get up from bed and
proceed at once on a journey to the town of Cardigan, as the man who
had committed such sacrilegious act was resting that night on a sofa in
a certain public house in that town with the silver cup under his
waistcoat. The farmer went to Cardigan, and when he arrived at the
public house named by the spirit, and entered a certain room, a strange
man who was lying on the sofa got up, and the stolen cup from under his
waistcoat fell to the floor. The farmer took it up in an instant, and
returned with all speed to Blaenporth, and placed the sacred
<span class="corr" id="xd24e5503" title="Source: vessed">vessel</span>
in the church once more. For his kindness and trouble in thus restoring
the sacred <span class="corr" id="c210" title=

angel of Blaenporth Church told the farmer that the bell would toll
three times before his death, and before the death of his descendants

<h3 class="main">A REMARKABLE ACCOUNT OF KNOCKING AND WAILING BEFORE
DEATH.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A few miles from Newcastle Emlyn there is a
farmhouse called Pen&rsquo;rallt-hebog, which is situated in the parish
of Bettws-Evan, in Cardiganshire.</p>
<p class="par">Besides Pen&rsquo;rallt-hebog there is also&mdash;or
there was&mdash;another house on the same farm known as
Pen&rsquo;rallt-Fach. And there lived at this Penrallt-fach about 25
years ago a tailor named Samuel Thomas, and his wife.</p>
<p class="par">About that time a very strange incident occurred, and
the following account of it was given me by Mr. S. Thomas himself an
intelligent middle-aged man who is still alive I believe.</p>
<p class="par">One morning, very early, Thomas beard a knocking at the
door of his bedroom, and he enquired from his bed &ldquo;who is
there?&rdquo; but there was no reply, and everything was quiet
again.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning again he heard knocking at the door,
though not the bedroom door this time, but the front door of the house.
My informant exclaimed from his bed, <span class="corr" id="xd24e5522"
title="Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Alright, I am getting up
now.&rdquo; But when he did get up, and opened the door, not a single
soul could be seen anywhere. Thomas was quite surprised, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>and
perplexed as to who could have come to disturb him at five
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, two mornings one after the other, and
disappear so mysteriously. No voice had been heard, nor the sound of
footsteps, only a knocking at the door. After this there was no further
knocking for some time.</p>
<p class="par">Twelve months to the very day after this a brother of
Thomas who lived in some other part of the country came on a visit, and
to spend a day with him, and this was in the first week of January,
1883. Some day during this week the two brothers went out with their
guns to shoot some game, but soon returned to the house again, and in
the evening Thomas went to his workshop to do some &ldquo;job&rdquo;;
but as he was busily engaged in making a suit of clothes, he heard a
knocking at the window quite suddenly&mdash;two knocks. He thought that
some friend outside wanted to call his attention to something; but when
he looked at the window there was no one to be seen After a while the
knocking went on again, and continued for about ten minutes.</p>
<p class="par">The second night the knocking at the window continued as
the previous evening between ten and eight o&rsquo;clock, but nothing
was to be seen.</p>
<p class="par">On the third night there was a knocking at the window
several times, and it was much louder or more violent than it had been
on the two previous evenings. The tailor and the young man who was his
assistant decided now to keep their eyes on the window, and as soon as
they did so there was no more knocking; but the moment they ceased
looking and resumed their work, the knocking was heard again. There
were several young men present in the room this evening, and they heard
the knocking, and even the wife heard it from another apartment of the
house.</p>
<p class="par">These &ldquo;spirit knockings&rdquo; had been now noised
abroad everywhere, and amongst others who went there in order to hear
them was the farmer on whose land the tailor lived. The farmer did not
believe in superstition, but when he heard the knocking he was
convinced that there was something supernatural about it.</p>
<p class="par">On the fifth night a very loud knock at the door was
heard as if some one attempted to break through; and on the sixth
evening when my informant went out for a short walk he heard such noise
as if two hundred horses were rushing by him.</p>
<p class="par">On the seventh and eighth evenings the knocking still
continued; and on the ninth evening, Thomas went out with a gun in his
hand, and found that there was no one to be seen anywhere, but he heard
some groaning voice in the air, and doleful wailing. The man returned
to the house quite frightened. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">There was no more knocking after this evening.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of January, 1883, at the very time when
these strange knockings, sound, and wailing were heard at
Pen&rsquo;rallt Fach cottage, a woman whose old home had been this very
house before she had left her native land was dying in America; and her
crying on her death-bed in that far-off land was heart-rending, when
she found that she was too ill to return to Wales, to die at her old
home in Cardiganshire, and to be buried with her husband, who had died
before she had left for America. One Mr. Lloyd, from Newcastle Emlyn,
happened to be at her death-bed in America, when she was longing in
vain to die in her old home in Wales. This solves the mystery of the
&ldquo;spirit knockings,&rdquo; and it also confirms the truth of the
old belief that Death makes his presence known by knocking at the door
of the relatives of friends of those he is about to strike.</p>

Soon after this, news came to the town that a ship from Aberystwyth got
lost on the coast of Spain, and that amongst others of the crew, who
were drowned, was the young Frenchman. The young woman discovered that
her lover was drowned on the Spanish Coast in the very same hour that

<p class="par">Curious Belief about Salt.&mdash;When people remove into
a new house it is customary to take a bar of salt into the building
before taking in any of the furniture. This is supposed to secure good
luck.</p>
<p class="par">When this salt ceremony is forgotten or neglected, some
people, especially women, are very much perturbed.</p>
<p class="par">I have discovered that this curious old belief about
salt is very common at present in the towns of Aberystwyth, Carmarthen,
and Tenby, and other parts of West Wales.</p>
<p class="par">To spill salt denotes quarrels. To serve another person

There is also the same superstition about boots all over Wales.</p>
<p class="par">Never mend your clothes while you are wearing them.</p>
<p class="par">If you see a pin pick it up to insure good luck.</p>
<p class="par">There is a saying in Welsh &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Gwell

down for a pin, than to bend down for nothing.) It seems that a needle,
however, is not considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=

any kind of fish, from the head downwards; and in order to ensure good
luck the proper way is to eat the fish from the tail towards the head.
This superstition is also known in Cornwall.</p>
<p class="par">If in making tea you forget to replace the lid on the
teapot, it is the sure sign of the arrival of a stranger.</p>
<p class="par">David Evans, a millwright, of Llandilo, informed me a
short time ago, that one evening when he was staying in Lampeter, the
woman of the house who was preparing tea for supper at a late hour,
forgot to replace the lid on the pot. When she found it out, she
exclaimed: &ldquo;A stranger is sure to come here to-night.&rdquo; The
husband and wife, and the millwright sat down by the fire till a late
hour, but there was no sign of a stranger; just as they were going to
bed, however, there was a knock at the door, and a stranger came
in!</p>
<p class="par">Superstitions about Knives.&mdash;To cross your knife
and fork is considered unlucky; and crossed knives foretell some
approaching disaster.</p>
<p class="par">To find a knife on the road or in a field is also
supposed to be a very bad omen. This superstition is very general in
all parts of Wales, and even in far off parts of the world as well.
Many years ago in Patagonia, South America, two friends of mine and
myself met in a field one morning by appointment, in connection with
some particular business. Each of us three had come from different
directions, and each of us had arrived at the spot the same time, and
when we came together, strange to say, we discovered that each of us
had found a knife on the way! The names of my two friends were Edwin
Roberts, and William James, one was a native of Flintshire, and the
other a native of Cardiganshire, both of them were no means
superstitious; but I well remember that they were very much perturbed
on account of the knives, and feared that some serious misfortune was
going to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>happen. As soon as we went home we heard the sad
news that a young man named Isaac Howells, was accidentally drowned in
the river!</p>
<p class="par">It is also very generally believed at present, that it
is unlucky to receive a knife as a present. In such cases it is
customary to pay a penny for the knife.</p>
<p class="par">Wish whenever you get the first taste of the season of
any kind of food. It is also considered very lucky to taste as many
Christmas puddings as you can.</p>
<p class="par">It is considered unlucky to pass under a ladder.</p>
<p class="par">When walking a long journey if your feet are sore rub
the feet of your stockings with soap.</p>
<p class="par">A ringing in the right ear is a sign of good news; but a
ringing in the left one, unpleasant news.</p>
<p class="par">When the palm of your left hand itches, you are about to
give away some money, or some one is blaming you; but when the palm of
you right hand itches, it is a sign that you are about to receive
money, or that someone is praising you or writing a kind letter to
you.</p>
<p class="par">When going on a journey, if the sole of your right foot
itches, the journey will be a pleasant one; but the contrary if the
left foot itches.</p>
<p class="par">A child born with a caul is supposed to be very lucky,
and he will always be safe from drowning. A caul is much appreciated
among sailors in West Wales, as it is believed that to keep one on
board the ship secures a safe voyage.</p>
<p class="par">In all parts of Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire, it is
generally believed among women that it is unlucky to cut the nails of
an infant under six months old. The mother bites them off as they
grow.</p>
<p class="par">Superstition about Whistling.&mdash;It is considered
unlucky for a young woman to whistle. Whistling is also, or at least
was regarded, as &ldquo;Talking with the Devil.&rdquo; Mr. Ferrar
Fenton in &ldquo;Pembrokeshire Antiquities<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e5751" title="Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; page 59, says, that
many years ago he happened to whistle one day whilst walking on the
pier at Fishguard with a young sea captain. The Captain seemed very
much perturbed at the whistling, and at last said to Mr.
Fenton:&mdash;&ldquo;I wish you would not whistle here!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why? What harm does it do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo;
he said slowly, as if shy at his words, &ldquo;We Welshmen and sailors
are superstitious over some things, and whistling as you now do, is one
of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Superstitious! Not you! But tell me about it: I
love all those old tales.&rdquo; &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;my mother and all the old <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>people told me when a boy
that such kind of whistling was the way Croignorian (Magicians) talk
with the Devil, and sailors believe something like it, and it always
makes my heart start to hear it, especially on the seashore.&rdquo;
Then he added, &ldquo;Look! how muggy it is behind Pencaer.
You&rsquo;ll bring a gale, and I always feel pity for the sailors
afloat when a sou&rsquo;-wester rages in the channel behind it.&rdquo;
When the great Divine and Martyr, Bishop Ferrar, of St. David&rsquo;s,
was burnt alive at Carmarthen in 1555, amongst other pretences for his
destruction he was accused of being a Magician, and &ldquo;teaching his
infant son to talk with the Devil by means of whistling.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the old days of sailing ships, wind was an agent of
great value; and sometimes sailors whistled for a wind, and this
whistling was considered a direct invocation to &ldquo;the prince of
the power of the air&rdquo; to exert himself on their behalf. I have
heard of an old man who is still alive who believes that the devil has
some control over wind and rain.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There are still lingering in Wales many beliefs
and practices with respect to the moon. It is considered unlucky to see
the new moon the first time through the window, and many persons go out
of doors to see her and show her a piece of money to insure good luck
while that moon lasts. I was told by an old gentleman in Cardiganshire
that he had seen many taking off their hats and <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e5764" title="Source: bow">bowing</span> to the new moon; some
ladies also make a curtsey to her, and it is considered very lucky to
see her over the right shoulder. If a person wishes anything when he
sees the new moon after New Year&rsquo;s Day, his wish will be granted
to him.</p>
<p class="par">Putting a Hen to Sit.&mdash;A hen is put to sit so as to
get the chick out of the egg at the waxing, and not at the waning of
the moon, as it is believed that the young birds are strong or weak
according to the age of the moon when they are hatched.</p>
<p class="par">Sowing.&mdash;There are still many people who are very
particular to sow their seeds in their gardens and their fields during
the first quarter of the moon, owing to the idea that the seed will
then germinate quicker, and grow stronger than when the moon is on the
wane. I knew a farmer&mdash;a native of Llanfynydd, in
Carmarthenshire&mdash;who was always very careful to sow his wheat
during the first quarter or the waxing of the moon, and it is a
well-known fact that he had always a good crop at harvest time.</p>
<p class="par">There are also people who are very particular about
having their hair cut just before or about full moon so that it might
grow better afterwards<span class="corr" id="xd24e5773" title=

of the moon is partially obscured by a light thin vapour rain is
coming.</p>

<h4 class="main">THE CUCKOO.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is believed in Cardiganshire and
Carmarthenshire by many, especially old people, that the cuckoo does
not go away from this country in winter, but sleeps in some sheltered
place. When a boy, I often heard the following ditty:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Amser y gwcw yw Ebrill a Mai,</p>
<p class="line">A hanner Mehefin, chwi wyddoch bob rhai.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(The Cuckoo&rsquo;s time is April and May,</p>
<p class="line">And half of June, as all know, I daresay).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The cuckoo making its appearance before the leaves
are on the hawthorn bush is a sign of a bad year; and for the bird not
to appear at its usual time is also a bad sign; hence:</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Gwcw Glamme,</p>
<p class="line">Cosyn dime.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">When you hear the cuckoo for the first time in the
season it is very important to have money in your pocket in order to
secure good luck for the coming year. People turn the money in their
pockets with their hands, and sometimes toss a piece into the air. It
is also considered very lucky to hear this bird for the first time when
you are standing on green grass; but if you are on the road or on bare
ground, it is otherwise.</p>
<p class="par">I have met people who do not like to hear the cuckoo for
the first time before they get up from bed in the morning. To see the
bird coming to the door is also regarded as an evil omen by some. A
woman in North Cardiganshire informed me that a cuckoo came to the door
before her father died. The cuckoo is supposed to be accompanied by the
wryneck known in Welsh as Gwas-y-Gwcw.</p>
<p class="par">If we are to believe an old legend, the cuckoo in former
times used to begin to sing at Nevern, in Pembrokeshire, on the 7th of
April, patron day of that parish; and George Owen of Henllys, who lived
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, says, &ldquo;I might well here omit an
old report as yet fresh, of this odious bird, that in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>old
world the parish priest of the Church would not begin mass until this
bird, called the citizen&rsquo;s ambassador, had first appeared and
began her note, on a stone called St. Byrnach&rsquo;s Stone, being
curiously wrought with sundry sorts of knots, standing upright in the
Church-yard of the parish, and one year staying very long, and the
priest and the people expecting her accustomed coming (for I account
this bird of the feminine gender) came at last, lighting on the said
stone, her accustomed preaching place, and being scarce able once to
sound the note, presently fell dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">According to another old legend, this stone upon which
the cuckoo began her note, was at first intended by St. David for
Llanddewi Brefi, but St. Brynach prevailed upon him to leave it at
Nevern. The Rev. J. T. Evans, Rector of Stow, gives this legend in
&ldquo;The Church Plate of Pembrokeshire.&rdquo;</p>

Swallow, have descended to us from remote antiquity; and among the

Wales, it was formerly believed that the swallow, like the cuckoo,
slept through the winter. This bird is also supposed to bring good
fortune to the house upon which it builds its nest. If, however, the
bird forsakes its old nest on a house, it is considered a sign of
ill-luck. It is also most unlucky to break a swallow&rsquo;s

To serve little children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit. No

from the land of fire, and, therefore, he feels the cold of winter far

also supposed to be &ldquo;hateful unto all birds.&rdquo; To account

is given by Mr. H. W. Evans, Solva, in the &ldquo;Pembrokeshire
Antiquities,&rdquo; p. 49:</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e6002" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>At one time all the birds unanimously
decided to elect unto themselves a king; and (probably with an eye on
the eagle) they resolved to crown monarch the bird that would soar the
highest. On a signal being given they all started on their upward
flight. After a very exciting contest the eagle was seen considerably
higher than all other birds. Having reached the highest altitude
possible he, in a loud voice, proclaimed himself king. &lsquo;No, no,
not yet,&rsquo; said a wren which had perched on the eagle&rsquo;s back
and had now flown a few yards higher. &lsquo;Come up here,&rsquo; said
the wren; but the eagle, having exhausted his strength, was unable to
raise himself, and so the wren became king. When the birds beheld their
king, they became very sad and sorrowful, and they cried bitterly.
Afterwards they met in solemn conclave, and decided to drown their king
in tears. So they procured a pan to hold their tears, and the birds
gathered and craned their necks over the pan and wept. But the owl
clumsily mounted the edge of the pan, thereby upsetting it, and spilled
the tears. The birds became enraged at this, and swore vengeance
against the owl, and ever since he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225"

during the day, and is obliged to seek his food at night, when all

There are traditions of these dangerous creatures in several parts of

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=

flying serpent. This superstition was very common in the southern part

a short time at Talybont in the northern part of the same county, a
rocky spot was pointed out to me, about a mile from the village, where,
according to tradition, a Gwiber which attacked people, had a lurking

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The most remarkable story of this kind is the
well-known tradition of the appearance of a gwiber or Flying Serpent in
the neighbourhood of Newcastle Emlyn, in the Vale of Teivi. This
interesting small town boasts of a fine old castle, or at least the
ruins of one, and it was upon the top of this castle the flying serpent
or dragon alighted and rested. According to some, this took place as
late as the eighteenth century, on a fine summer day. The flying
creature was seen about mid-day, and as there was a fair at Newcastle
Emlyn that day the town was crowded with people. The appearance of the
&ldquo;Gwiber&rdquo; or dragon terrified the people, both old and
young, and they feared that their lives were in jeopardy. The strange
creature&rsquo;s skin was covered by a hard and stony substance or
shell, except the navel. The people were afraid of attempting to kill
this flying monster, and did not know what to do. Fortunately, a
valiant soldier who had been fighting for his country on land and sea,
volunteered to put an end to the life of this strange and terrific
creature, or die in the attempt. So taking off all his clothes, except
his trousers, he proceeded with his gun in hand and stood right in the
river. He then took a good aim at the creature&rsquo;s navel which was
the only part of its body not covered with shell. As soon as the
soldier fired, in order to escape an attack from the flying serpent, he
left a red flannel on the surface of the water, whilst he himself dived
into the river and, at last, by swimming against the current, succeeded
to land safely on the bank on the other side. The serpent fell or
rushed into the river and began to attack the red flannel, but it was
soon discovered that the creature had been mortally wounded, for the
water of the river was coloured with its blood.</p>

Brython,&rdquo; fifty years ago, and another version of it written by

belief in witchcraft, is often alluded to by Shakespeare. In times gone
by witches held dreaded sway over the affairs of men, perhaps more or
less in almost every country; for they were suspected to have entered
into a league with Satan, in order to obtain power to do evil, and it
was thought that they possessed some uncanny knowledge which was used
by them to injure people, especially those whom they hated. It was also
believed that they could cause thunder and lightning, could travel on
broomsticks through the air, and even transform themselves and others
into animals, especially into hares. A good many other imaginary things
were also placed to the credit of witches.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of last century, and even up to the
middle of it, witchcraft was very <span class="corr" id="xd24e6164"
title="Source: strongy">strongly</span> believed in in many parts of
Pembrokeshire, Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, Radnorshire, and
Montgomeryshire. Even at the present time, there are some who believe
that there is in it something more than a mere deception. I have met
several who still believe in it. Many well-known characters were proud
of being looked upon as witches and conjurors; because they were feared
as such and could influence people to be charitable to them. Many an
old woman supposed to be a witch, took advantage of the credulity of
the people, went about the farm houses to request charity in the way of
oat-meal, butter, milk, etc., and could get almost anything, especially
from the women, from fear of being witched; for it was believed that
these witches could bring misfortune on families, cause sickness, and
bring a curse on both men and animals; so that many used to imagine
that they were bewitched whenever anything went wrong, even a slight
mischance. Unfaithful young men would soon fulfil their promise when
they found out that the girl they had slighted was consulting a witch,
so that there was some good even in such a foolish superstition as
witchcraft. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=

John Davies, Gogoyan Farm, a, farmer who had heard it from old
people:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">Sometime in the beginning of the last century, two old
dames attended the morning service at Llanddewi Brefi Church, and
partook of the Holy Communion; but instead of eating the sacred bread
like other communicants, they kept it in their mouths and went out.
Then they walked round the Church outside nine times, and at the ninth
time the Evil One came out from the Church wall in the form of a frog,
to whom they gave the bread from their mouths, and by doing this wicked
thing they were supposed to be selling themselves to Satan and become
witches. It was also added that after this they were sometimes seen
swimming in the river Teivi in form of hares!</p>
<p class="par">According to Cadrawd, there was an old man in North
Pembrokeshire, who used to say that he obtained the power of bewitching
in the following manner:&mdash;The bread of his first Communion he
pocketed. He made pretence at eating it first of all, and then put it
in his pocket. When he went out from the service there was a dog
meeting him by the gate, to which he gave the bread, thus selling his
soul to the Devil. Ever after, he possessed the power to bewitch.</p>

of one particularly malicious old woman who in her time had proved a
terror to the neighbourhood. On one occasion, a well-known family who
practised the black art and were guilty of witchcraft, wanted to become
members of the Baptist Chapel at Caersalem, and at last they were
admitted; but after being received as members of the chapel, they were
ten times worse than before. One witch during Divine Service, even on
the very day she became a communicant, witched a young woman who was a
fellow servant of my informant at a farm called Gellifor, near Cilgwyn.
The witch was sitting behind, and in the very next pew to the young

the man that his daughter had been witched in chapel by an old woman
who was a witch, and he showed him the whole scene in a magic mirror!

time kept a school in the neighbouring parish of Llanpumpsaint, and
lived at a place called Fos-y-Broga. At the woman&rsquo;s request the
conjurer accompanied her home to see her daughter. After seeing the
girl he entered into a private room alone for a few minutes, and wrote
something on a sheet of paper which he folded up and tied it with a
thread. This he gave to the woman and directed her to put the thread
round her daughter&rsquo;s neck, with the folded paper suspending on
her breast. He also told the mother to remember to be at the
girl&rsquo;s bedside at twelve o&rsquo;clock that night. The young

clock struck twelve she heard her daughter groaning. She ran at once to
the poor girl&rsquo;s bedside, and found her almost dying with pain;

ever. The conjurer had told the girl&rsquo;s mother that she had been
bewitched by the Gypsies, which caused her illness, and warned the
young woman to keep away from such vagrants in the future. The
Conjurer&rsquo;s paper, which had charmed away her illness was put away

<h3 class="main">A FARMER&rsquo;S DAUGHTER AT WALTON EAST, IN
PEMBROKESHIRE BEWITCHED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS FOR REFUSING ALMS TO AN OLD
HAG.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mrs. Mary Williams, Dwrbach, a very old woman,
informed me, that about 55 years ago, there was a well-known witch in
the neighbourhood of Walton East, and that on one occasion two young
women, daughters of a farm in that part of the country, were taken ill
quite suddenly, and were supposed to have been witched by this old
woman. The mother of the two young women went to the witch and rebuked
the old hag, saying: &ldquo;Old woman, why did you witch my daughters?
Come and undo thy wickedness.&rdquo; The old woman replied that she did
not do anything to them. But the mother still believing that she was
guilty, compelled her to come along with her to the farmhouse and undo
her mischief. At last, she came, and when they reached the door of the
farmhouse, the witch pronounced these words in Welsh:
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Duw ai bendithio hi.</span>&rdquo; (God bless
her). Any such expression pronounced by a witch freed the bewitched
person or an animal from the spell. One of the two sisters (both of
whom were in bed in another room), overheard these words of the old
woman, but her sister did not hear or at least did not catch the words.
The young woman who heard the supposed witch saying &ldquo;<span lang=
"cy">Duw a&rsquo;i bendithio hi</span>,&rdquo; got well at once, but
her poor sister who missed hearing, instead of recovering went worse,
if anything, than before, and continued to keep to her bed for fifteen
years. And during all these years she was so strange, that even when
her own mother entered her room, she would hide under the bed clothes
like a rat, and her food had to be left on her bed for her, for she
would not eat in the presence of anybody. At last, the old woman who
was thought to have witched the young woman, died, and as the the
mortal remains of the witch were decaying in the grave, the girl began
to get better, and she soon fully recovered and became quite herself
again after fifteen years&rsquo; illness. My informant added that after
recovering, the young woman got married and received &pound;1,500 from
her parents on her wedding-day, and that she is still alive (or was
very lately) and a wife of a well-to-do farmer. My informant also said
that she was well acquainted with the family.</p>

between Llanilar and Lledrod, was for some time suffering from almost
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>unbearable bodily pain, and did not know what to
do. The general belief was that he had been bewitched by an old woman
who was a terror to the neighbourhood; and at last a man went to
Llangurig, in Montgomeryshire, to consult a wise man about it. It was
found out soon afterwards that as soon as the conjurer was consulted,
the sick man fully recovered from his illness, got up from bed, dressed
himself, and came down from his bedroom and felt as well as ever, to
the very great surprise and joy of all his family and friends. My
informant, Thomas Jones, of Pontrhydfendigaid, who knew the man well,
vouches for the truth of this story.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Jones also gave me an account of another man who was
witched by the same old hag. The wife of Rhys Rhys, Pwllclawdd and her
sister were churning all day, but the milk would not turn to butter.
Rhys, at last, went to the old witch and asked her to come and undo her
mischief, as she had witched the milk. She was very unwilling to come,
but Rhys compelled her. When Mrs. Rhys and her sister saw the old witch
coming, they ran to hide themselves in a bedroom. The hag took hold of
the churn&rsquo;s handle for a few seconds, and the milk turned to
excellent butter at once; but poor Rhys who had always been a strong
man till then, never enjoyed a day of good health after; for the old
hag witched the farmer himself in revenge for compelling her to unwitch
the milk.</p>

the old witch was greatly feared by the people of the neighbourhood, as
it was generally believed that the hag cursed or witched those whom she
disliked. On one occasion, when her neighbour&rsquo;s horse broke
through the hedge into her field, she witched the animal for
trespassing. The horse was shivering all over and everything was done
in vain to cure the poor animal; but the very moment John Morgan, the
Llangurig conjurer was consulted, the horse fully recovered, and looked
as well as ever. My informant vouches for the truth of this, and says
he had seen the horse, and that the man who consulted the conjurer was
a friend of his, and, that he even knew the conjurer himself.</p>

<h3 class="main">ANOTHER CARDIGANSHIRE STORY OF MILK THAT WOULD NOT
TURN TO BUTTER.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following account was given me by Mr. Jenkin
Williams, Llangwyryfon:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">There was a man and his family living at a cottage
called Penlon, a small place just enough to keep one cow. The name of
the man was John Jones; and on one occasion when he and his wife were
trying to churn they failed to do so, or in other words the milk would
not turn into butter. At last J. Jones went to Cwrt-y-Cadno, in
Carmarthenshire to consult the &ldquo;Dyn Hysbys.&rdquo; The wizard as
he often did, gave the man a bit of paper with some mystic words on it,
and told him not to show it to anybody, as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>charm could not work after showing the paper to
others. As he was passing on his way home through a place called Cwm
Twrch, he met with a woman who accosted him and asked him where he had
been to. The man was rather shy, but at last he admitted that he had
been to Cwrt-y-Cadno to consult the conjurer, and he told the woman
everything. &ldquo;I well knew<span class="corr" id="xd24e6290" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;You had been to
Cwrt-y-Cadno, for only those who go to the conjurer pass this way; show
me the paper which he gave to you, for I am a cousin of the
conjurer.&rdquo; And the man showed it to her. &ldquo;The paper is
alright<span class="corr" id="xd24e6293" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; said she<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6296" title="Not in source">,</span> &ldquo;Take it home with you
as soon as you can.&rdquo; He went home with great joy, but
unfortunately the churning still proved a failure. Instead of
undertaking another journey himself again, J. Jones went to his
neighbour Jenkin Williams, and begged him to go to the conjurer to
obtain another paper for him, and at last J. Williams went. The
conjurer, however, was not willing to give another paper without
&pound;1 cash for it; but he gave it at last for a more moderate price,
when my informant pleaded the poverty of his friend. When Williams
asked the wise man what was the reason that the milk would not churn,
the reply was that an enemy had cursed it by wishing evil to his
neighbour. When this second paper was taken home (which was not shown
to anybody on the road), the milk was churned most successfully, and
splendid butter was obtained.</p>
<p class="par">In some places a hot smoothing iron thrown into the
churn was effective against the witch&rsquo;s doings.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In some of the stories I have already given a
paper obtained from a conjurer in the way of charm was considered very
effective to undo the witch&rsquo;s evil doings; but from the following
story, which I obtained from David Pugh, Erwlwyd, it seems that it was
necessary in some cases to bury this bit of paper in the ground. It was
also thought a few generations ago, that a letter hidden under a stone
was a good thing to keep away both witches and evil spirits and to
secure good luck to a house.</p>
<p class="par">Many years ago in the neighbourhood of Llandilo,
Carmarthenshire, a young farmer was engaged to be married to a daughter
of another farmer; but a few days before the wedding-day the bride and
bridegroom and their families quarrelled, so that the wedding did not
take place. After this, ill-luck attended the young farmer day after
day; many of his cattle died till he became quite a poor man very
depressed in spirit. The young woman who had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>engaged to him was a supposed witch so she was
suspected of having caused all his misfortunes. His friends advised him
to consult a wizard, and he did so, as there was a &ldquo;dyn
hysbys&rdquo; close by at Llandilo, in those days, so it was said. The
wizard informed the farmer that he and his friends were right in their
suspicions about the young woman, and that his losses had been brought
about by her who had once been engaged to be married to him. Then the
wizard wrote something on a sheet of paper and handed it to the young
farmer directing him to bury this paper down in the ground underneath
the gate-post at the entrance to his farmyard. The young man went home
and buried the paper as directed by the wizard, and from that time
forth nothing went wrong.</p>

compelled the witch to undo her work. Mrs. Thomas also added that when
the heart was burning on such occasions the smoke would go right in the
direction of the witch&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p class="par">Another old woman near Fishguard, informed the Rev. J.
W. Evans, a son of the Rector of Jordanston, that she remembered an old

cattle. At last she was forced to leave the district by the people who
believed her to be a witch. But soon after she left a cow died, and
even her calves were ill. People took out the cow&rsquo;s heart and

there was once a particular witch in that town who was very
troublesome, as she was always begging, and that people always gave to
her, as they were afraid of offending her. She often came to beg from
his mother, who at last, as advised by her friends, procured a big nail
from a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop. She put the nail under her foot on the
floor, the next time the old witch came to the door begging. The old
hag came again as usual to beg and to threaten; but my

their own farm; but whenever put in any field of another farm they
would graze splendidly. My informant&rsquo;s mother could not

she took the advice of friends and went to consult the Wizard of
Cwrt-y-Cadno, who informed her that an enemy with whom she was well

buy a new knife, (one that had never been used before), and go directly
to a particular spot in the field where a solitary &ldquo;pren
cerdinen&rdquo; (mountain ash) grew, and cut it with this new knife.
This mountain ash, and some of the cows&rsquo; hair, as well as some
&ldquo;witch&rsquo;s butter&rdquo; she was to tie together and burn in
the fire; and that by performing this ceremony or charm, she should see
the person who was guilty of witching her cows, coming to the door or
the window of her house. My informant told me that his mother carried
out these directions, and that everything happened as the wizard had

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of all things to frustrate the evil designs of
witches the best was a piece of mountain ash, or as it is called in
Welsh &ldquo;pren cerdinen.&rdquo; The belief in mountain ash is very
old in Wales, and the tree was held sacred in ancient times, and some
believe that the Cross of our Lord was made of it. Witches had a
particular dread of this wood, so that a person who carried with him a
branch of &ldquo;pren cerdinen&rdquo; was safe from their spells; and
it is believed in Wales, as well as in parts of England, that the witch
who was touched with a branch of it was the victim carried off by the
devil when he came next to claim his tribute&mdash;once every seven
years.</p>
<p class="par">I was told a few years ago at Talybont, that many in
that part of Cardiganshire grew mountain ash in their gardens, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>that a man carrying home a little pig was seen
with a branch of this wood to protect the animal from witchcraft. In
South Pembrokeshire many carry in their pockets a twig of the mountain
ash when going on a journey late at night; and a woman at Llanddewi
Brefi, in Cardiganshire, Miss Anne Edwards, Penbontgoian, informed me
about seven years ago that when she was a child the <span class="corr"
id="xd24e6340" title="Source: neighbourood">neighbourhood</span> was
full of witches, but nothing was so effective against them as the
mountain ash; no witch would come near it. A man travelling on
horseback, especially at night, was very much exposed to the old hags,
and the horse was more so than even the man riding the animal; but a
branch or even a twig of the mountain ash carried in hand and held over
the horse&rsquo;s head, protected both the animal and the rider against
all the spells of witches. The same woman informed me that on one
occasion, the servant man and the servant girl of Llanio Isaf, in that
parish, were going to the mill one night, but all of a sudden they
found both themselves and their horse and cart right on the top of a
hedge. This was the work of the witches. After this, they carried a
mountain ash, so as to be safe.</p>
<p class="par">Another old woman in Pembrokeshire, named Mrs. Mary
Williams, Dwrbach, informed me that a notorious old hag who was
supposed to be a witch, was coming home on one occasion from
Haverfordwest fair, in a cart with a farmer who had kindly taken her
up. As they were driving along the road between <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6345" title="Source: Haverford-West">Haverfordwest</span> and
Walton East, they happened to notice three teams harrowing in a field,
and the farmer who was driving the cart asked the witch whether she
could by her spells stop the teams? &ldquo;I could stop two of
them,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but the third teamster has a piece of
mountain ash fast to his whip, so I cannot do anything to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Mary <span class="corr" id="xd24e6350" title=
"Source: Wliliams">Williams</span> also informed me that when she was a
little girl her mother always used to say to her and the other children
on the last day of December: &ldquo;Now children, go out and fetch a
good supply of mountain ash to keep the witches away on New
Year&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; and branches of it were stuck into the wall
about the door, windows and other places outside. Then witches coming
to beg on New Year&rsquo;s Day could do no harm to the inmates of the
house.</p>
<p class="par">In Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, and North
Pembrokeshire, the mountain ash is called &ldquo;pren cerdinen,&rdquo;
but it was once known in the South of Pembrokeshire, where the people
are not of Welsh origin, as &ldquo;rontree&rdquo;; and the name
&ldquo;rowan&rdquo; is still retained in some parts of England, which
is derived according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Witches were supposed to transform themselves into
animals, especially that of an hare. And this belief is a very old one,
for Giraldus Cambrensis seven hundred years ago in his
&ldquo;Topography of Ireland,<span class="corr" id="xd24e6368" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (Bonn&rsquo;s edition) says: &ldquo;It
has also been a frequent complaint, from old times as well as in the
present, that certain hags in Wales, as well as in Ireland and
Scotland, changed themselves into the shape of hares, that, sucking
teats under this counterfeit form, they might stealthily rob other
people&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo; Tales illustrative of this very old belief
are still extant in Wales, and John Griffiths, Maenclochog, in
Pembrokeshire, related to me the story of:</p>

<p class="par first">Griffiths informed me that when his mother was
young, she was engaged as a servant maid at a small gentleman&rsquo;s
seat, called Pontfaen, in the Vale of Gwaun. But whenever she went out
early in the morning to milk the cows, an old witch who lived in the
neighbourhood always made her appearance in the form of an hare,
annoying the girl very much. At last she informed her master of it, and
at once the gentleman took his gun and shot the hare; but somehow, the
animal escaped, though he succeeded in wounding and drawing blood from
her. After this, the young woman went to see the old hag who was
supposed to be a witch, Maggie by name, and found her in bed with a
sore leg. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following tale was told me by a Mrs. Edwards,
Ysbytty Ystwyth, in Cardiganshire:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">An old witch who lived at Tregaron, went to Trecefel, a
large farm in the neighbourhood, to beg for the use of a small corner
of a field to grow some potatoes for herself. The farmer himself was
away from home at the time, but his wife was willing, as she was afraid
of offending the witch. The head servant, however, refused her request,
and sent her away, which naturally made her very angry, and in
departing she used threatening words. One day, soon after this, the
same servant was out in the field, and he noticed a hare in the hedge
continually looking at him, and watching all his movements. It occurred
to him at last that this creature was the old witch he had offended,
appearing in the form of a hare, and somehow or other he had not the
least doubt in his mind about it, so he procured a gun and fired, but
the shot did not inflict any injury on the hare. In the evening, when
he met some of his friends at a house in the village, the man servant
told them everything about the hare and of his suspicion that she was
the witch. One of his friends told him that ordinary shots or bullets
were no good to shoot a witch with, but that it was necessary for him
to load his gun with a bent four-penny silver coin<span class="corr"
id="xd24e6384" title="Source: ,">.</span> He tried this, and the next
time he fired the hare rolled over<a id="xd24e6387" name=
"xd24e6387"></a> screaming terribly. Soon after this, people called to
see the old woman in her cottage, and found that she had such a wound
in her leg that she could hardly move. Dr. Rowland was sent for, and
when he came and examined her leg he found a fourpenny silver coin in
two pieces in it. &ldquo;You old witch<span class="corr" id="xd24e6389"
title="Not in source">,</span>&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am not going to
take any trouble with you again: death is good enough for your
sort,&rdquo; and die she did.</p>
<p class="par">The possibility of injuring or marking the witch in her
assumed form so deeply that the bruise remained a mark on her in her
natural form was a common belief<span class="corr" id="xd24e6394"

<p class="par first">The following tale was told me by Mrs. Mary
Thomas, Bengal, near Fishguard:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The Squire of Llanstinan, was a great huntsman, but
whenever he went out with his hounds, a certain hare always baffled and
escaped from the dogs. He followed her for miles and miles, day after
day, but always failed to catch the animal. At last the <span class=

been a witch in the shape of a hare, and the gentleman was advised to
get &ldquo;a horse and a dog of the same colour,&rdquo; and he did so.
So the next time he was hunting he had a horse and a dog of the <a id=
"xd24e6406" name="xd24e6406"></a>same colour, and they were soon
gaining ground on the hare; but when the dog was on the very point of
catching the animal, the hare suddenly disappeared through a hole in
the door of a cottage. The Squire hurried to the spot and instantly
opened the door, but to his great surprise the hare had assumed the
form of an old woman, and he shouted out: &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Oh! ti

Llanarth, who kept hounds and was fond of hunting. One day, he was
hunting a hare that a little boy of nine years old had started; but the
hare not only managed to elude her pursuers, but even to turn back and
attack the hounds. The hunting of this hare was attempted day after
day, but with the same results; and the general opinion in the
neighbourhood was, that this hare was nothing but an old witch who
lived in that part, with whom the huntsman had quarrelled.</p>
<p class="par">An old man in Carmarthenshire informed me that an old
woman known as Peggy Abercamles, and her brother Will, in the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">From the following story which I heard at
Talybont, in North Cardiganshire, it seems that witches did not always
transform themselves. In some cases it was thought that the hare was
not the witch herself, but the old hag&rsquo;s Familiar Spirit assuming
the shape of a hare in her stead; but the life of the witch was so
closely connected with the Familiar, that when the Familiar was shot,
the witch suffered.</p>
<p class="par">The tale is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">There was an old woman at Llanfihangel Genau&rsquo;r
Glyn, who was supposed to be a witch. One day a man in the
neighbourhood shot a hare with a piece of silver coin. At the very time
when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=

was at home washing, but fell into the tub, wounded and bleeding. It
was supposed by the people of the neighbourhood that the hare which was
shot was the old hag&rsquo;s familiar spirit.</p>

<h3 class="main">MEN CHANGED INTO ANIMALS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is said that an old witch near Ystrad Meurig,
in Cardiganshire, turned a servant man of a farm called Dolfawr, into a
hare on one occasion; and into a horse on another occasion and rode him
herself.</p>
<p class="par">In the Mabinogion we have the Boar Trwyth, who was once
a King, but God had transformed into a swine for his sins. Nynniaw and
Peibaw also had been turned into oxen. And in the topography of
Ireland, by Giraldus Cambrensis, mention is made of a man and a woman,
natives of Ossory, who through the curse of one Natalis, had been
compelled to assume the form of wolves. And while speaking of witches
changing themselves into hares the same writer adds: &ldquo;We agree,
then, with Augustine, that neither demons nor wicked men can either
create or really change their nature, but those whom God has created
can, to outward appearance, by His permission, become transformed, so
that they appear to be what they are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If learned men, like Augustine and Giraldus Cambrensis
and others, believed such stories, it is no wonder that ignorant people
did so. I am inclined to believe, like the late Rev. Elias Owen, that
the transformation fables that have descended to us would seem to be
fossils of a pagan faith once common to the Celtic and other cognate
races.</p>
<p class="par">The belief in transformation and transmigration has
lingered among some people almost to the present day. Mr. Thomas Evans,
Gwaralltyryn, in the parish of Llandyssul, informed me that he was
well-acquainted with an old Ballad singer, who was known as Daniel Y
Baledwr. Daniel lived near Castle Howel, and sang at Llandyssul fairs,
songs composed by Rees Jones, of Pwllffein. This ballad-singer told my
informant that he was sure to return after death in the form of a pig,
or of some other animal; and that an animal had a soul or spirit as
well as a man had.</p>

<h3 class="main">WIZARDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There were many conjurers in Wales in former
times, and even at the present day there are a few who have the
reputation of practising the Black Art; for we still hear occasionally
of persons taking long journeys to consult them, especially in cases of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>supposed bewitched cattle, horses, pigs, etc. I
have already given stories of <span class="corr" id="xd24e6449" title=
"Source: conjurors">conjurers</span> counteracting the machinations of
witches, and delivering both people and animals from their spell. But
they were accredited with the power to do many other things beside.
They could, it was thought, compel a thief to restore what he had
stolen; could also reveal the future and raise and command spirits.</p>
<p class="par">The possibility of raising spirits, or to cause them to
appear, was once believed in in Wales, even in recent times; and
Shakespeare in his Henry the Fourth, Act III., S. 1., makes the
Welshman, Glendower say:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;I can call Spirits from the vasty
deep.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Wizards and others who practised magical arts were
supposed to be able to summon spirits at will; but it seems that some
could not control the demons after summoning them. An old man at
Llandovery, named Mr. Price, who was once a butler at Blaennos,
informed me <span class="corr" id="xd24e6459" title=
"Source: tbat">that</span> an old witch at Cilcwm, named Peggy, found
it most difficult to control the spirits in the house, and sometimes
she had to go out into a field, and stand within a circle of protection
with a whip in her hand.</p>
<p class="par">Conjurers possessed books dealing with the black art,
which they had to study most carefully, for it was thought that
according to the directions of magical books the spirits were
controlled. It was considered dangerous for one ignorant of the occult
science to open such books, as demons or familiar spirits came out of
them, and it was not always easy to get rid of such unearthly beings.
An old woman at Caio, in Carmarthenshire, informed me that the great
modern wizard Dr. Harries, of Cwrtycadno, who lived in that parish, had
one particular book kept chained and padlocked. The old woman also
added that people were much afraid of this book, and that even the
wizard himself was afraid of it, for he only ventured to open it once
in twelve months, and that in the presence and with the assistance of
another conjurer, a schoolmaster from Pencader, who occasionally
visited him. On a certain day once every twelve months, Dr. Harries and
his friend went out into a certain wooded spot not far from the house,
and after drawing a circle round them, they opened the chained book.
Whenever this ceremony was performed it caused thunder and lightning
throughout the Vale of Cothi. My informant vouched for the truth of
this, and stated that her husband had been a servant to Harries.</p>
<p class="par">A wizard in Pembrokeshire, named William Gwyn, of Olmws,
Castell Newydd Bach, with his magic book invoked a familiar spirit.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=

William commanded him to bring some water from the River in a
riddle<span class="corr" id="xd24e6468" title="Source: !.">!</span></p>
<p class="par">In the 18th century a well-known wizard in the same
county was one John Jenkins, a schoolmaster. But the greatest wizard in
the beginning of 19th century was Aby Biddle, of Millindingle, who was
in league with the evil one or at <span class="corr" id="c247" title=
"Corrected by author from: east">least</span> many of the people in
South Pembrokeshire believed so. Aby Biddle&rsquo;s real name was
Harries; but, of course, he was not the same person as Harries of
Cwrtycadno, in Carmarthenshire. There are still many most curious
stories concerning him in South Pembrokeshire, and as typical of other
tales, I give the following story which appeared a few years ago in
&ldquo;The Welsh Tit Bits&rdquo; column of the &ldquo;Cardiff
Times:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE PRIESTS AND THE HORNETS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the winter of 1803 there was an evening
gathering at the &mdash;&mdash; Vicarage, which consisted chiefly of
clerics, and Aby Biddle was of the number of the guests, having been
invited as a source of pastime to help beguile some of the long hours
of that forsaken spot. Seldom did he go beyond the solemn dingle, but
he had been prevailed upon on this occasion. Much merriment was
expected, nor was the expectation misleading, save that it was entirely
at the expense of the clerics. The hours glided along gently on the
wings of fairy tales. The party remained until the small hours of the
morning, singing, merry-making, and tale-telling in turn. The
conversation now furtively drifted in the direction of occult science.
Aby Biddle sat near the window. Every now and again as he listened to
the words magic and witchcraft and various opinions respecting them, he
pulled back a corner of the blind and the pale light of the moon
flickered on his countenance, revealing the lines of a retreating
smile.</p>
<p class="par">A loquacious young cleric interposed a caustic remark at
this point and fanned the fire into flame, and the discussion was like
to have taken a somewhat lively turn had not a broad-browed divine on
whose head rested the snow of full three score winters and ten, sternly
rebuked the young priest. This divine denounced sorcery and conjuration
in unmeasured language. Another aged divine of Puritanic air nodded his
assent.</p>
<p class="par">Aby Biddle said nothing, though some of the company
invited him to speak, but played carefully with the fringe of the
curtain. During a momentary lull in the conversation, he rose suddenly,
paced the room for a minute or two, and disappeared into the lawn. He
was not gone many seconds before he returned with three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>small rings in his hands. He held these up and
remarked, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we&rsquo;ll see whether conjuring is
possible or not.&rdquo; He placed the rings on the floor, at a distance
of about a yard apart, and hurriedly left the room, taking care to turn
the key in the lock on the smooth side of the door. The priests turned
their gaze intently in the direction of the rings. Suddenly there
appeared in one of the rings a fly flitting and buzzing. The fly grew.
In half a minute or less it had grown into a monster hornet. No sooner
had this metamorphosis taken place than it frisked into one of the
other rings, and another fly appeared in its place. This one also
developed into a hornet, giving way, when fully formed, to a third fly.
Each ring was now occupied, and the clerics wondered what next would
happen. Little time had they for musing, for the third fly quickly
accomplished its transformation, when the first one left the ring and
flew through the room. New hornets appeared in quick and quicker
succession. The guests became now thoroughly alarmed. Priestly
amusement gave way to pallid amazement. More and more came the dreaded
hornets, louder and louder their droning hum. They filled the room,
they darkened the whitened ceiling, and insinuated themselves into the
hoary locks of the Puritanic divine so that he yelled hoarsely. It was
utter confusion, and all were rushing wildly here and there for refuge
or escape, when the conjuror reappeared with a merry laugh, and a loud
&ldquo;Ho! is conjuring possible now, gentlemen?&rdquo; The Cloth was
soon pacified, the hornets dismissed to their sylvan home, and the
reputation of the Aby Biddle established as a mighty magician in the
minds of some noted parsons of Pembrokeshire.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">About two hundred years ago there lived in the
neighbourhood of Ysbytty Ystwyth, in Cardiganshire, a wizard and a
medical man, known as Sir Dafydd Llwyd, who had been a clergyman before
he was turned out by the Bishop for dealing in the Black Art. According
to &ldquo;A Relation of Apparitions,&rdquo; by the Rev. Edmund Jones,
it was thought that he had learnt the magic art privately at Oxford in
the profane time of Charles II. Like other wizards Sir Dafydd also had
a Magic Book, for the Rev. Edmund Jones tells us that on one occasion
when he had &ldquo;gone on a visit towards the Town of Rhaiadr Gwy, in
Radnorshire, and being gone from one house to another, but having
forgotten his Magic Book in the first house, sent his boy to fetch it,
charging him not to open the book on the way; but the boy being very
curious opened the book, and the evil Spirit immediately called for
work; the boy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>though surprised and in some perplexity, said,
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Tafl gerrig o&rsquo;r afon</span>,&mdash;(throw
stones out of the river) he did so; and after a while having thrown up
many stones out of the river Wye, which ran that way, he again after
the manner of confined Spirits, asking for something to do; the boy had
his senses about him to bid it to throw the stones back into the river,
and he did so. Sir David seeing the boy long in coming, doubted how it
was; came back and chided him for opening the book, and commanded the
familiar Spirit back into the book.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">SIR DAFYDD DEFEATING A RIVAL WIZARD.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">According to the stories still extant in North
Cardiganshire, this Sir Dafydd Llwyd had a most wonderful control over
the demons.</p>
<p class="par">The following tale was told me by Mr. D. Jones,
Bryntirion, Llanilar:</p>
<p class="par">A rival wizard who lived in the neighbourhood of
Lampeter, on one occasion challenged Sir Dafydd to a contest in the
black art, in order to prove to the world which of the two wizards was
the cleverest in controlling the demons. On the morning of the
appointed day for the contest between the two experts in the black art,
Sir Dafydd sent his boy to an elevated spot to have a look round if he
could see a bull coming from the direction of Lampeter. The boy went,
but ran back immediately to inform his master that a most savage bull
was approaching. Off went Sir Dafydd to Craig Ysguboriau, and stood on
the spot with his open magic book in his hand. The bull, or rather a
demon in the form of a bull, fiercely attempted to rush at him, but Sir
Dafydd compelled him to return whence he came. The animal returned to
Lampeter and rushed at once at the Lampeter wizard, and killed him. So
Sir Dafydd defeated and got rid of his rival.</p>
<p class="par">Another story I heard at Ysbytty Ystwyth was that one
Sunday morning when Sir Dafydd went to Church, he sent his boy to keep
away the crows from the wheat field; but when he came home he found
that the boy had collected all the crows into the barn. Sir Dafydd at
once discovered that the boy had learnt the Black Art.</p>
<p class="par">There is a tradition in the neighbourhood that the body
of Sir Dafydd lays buried under the wall of Yspytty Ystwyth Churchyard,
and not inside in the Churchyard itself, and people still believe that
this is a fact. The story goes that the wizard had sold himself to the
devil. The agreement was that the arch-fiend was to have possession of
Sir Dafydd if his corpse were taken over the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>side
of the bed, or through a door, or if buried in a churchyard. In order
to escape from becoming a prey to the Evil One, the wizard on his
death-bed had begged his friends to take away his body by the foot, and
not by the side of the bed, and through a hole in the wall of the
house, and not through the door, and to bury him, not in the churchyard
nor outside, but right under the churchyard wall. So that his Satanic
majesty, who had been looking forward for the body of Sir Dafydd, was
disappointed after all.</p>
<p class="par">That it was formerly believed that the devil could be
out-witted or deceived is evident from the fact that in the Middle Ages
it was often customary to bury an ungodly rich man in the garb of a
Monk. This could be done by paying the Monks a certain sum of
money.</p>
<p class="par">There is a story very much like the one I have just
given, to be found in the South-Western part of Montgomeryshire. In the
Montgomeryshire version, however, the wizard is not Sir Dafydd Llwyd,
but Dafydd Hiraddug, who had charged his friends, that on his death,
the liver and lights were to be taken out of his body and thrown on the
dunghill. They were then to take notice whether a raven or a dove got
possession of them; if a dove got possession of them, he was to be
buried like any other man in the churchyard; but if a raven, then he
was to be buried under the wall, and under the wall he was buried, as a
raven got possession of the liver and lights.</p>
<p class="par">The devil in disappointment cried out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Dafydd Hiraddug ei ryw,</p>
<p class="line">Ffals yn farw<span class="corr" id="xd24e6524" title=

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">(Dafydd Hiraddug, ill-bred</p>
<p class="line">False when living, false when dead.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The dove and the raven play their part in many of
the wizards tales. An old man from Llandilo, named David Evans,
informed me that the wizard of Cwrtycadno asked his friends to throw
his heart on the dunghill. If a dove came for it first, he had been a
good man; but a raven, a sign that he had been a bad man.</p>
<p class="par">The appearance of a dove at the time of a death or a
funeral was regarded as a sure sign that the deceased had been a good
man. The Rev. Edmund Jones in his &ldquo;Apparitions,&rdquo; referring
to the death of a certain godly man, says that &ldquo;Before the body
was brought forth, a white dove came and alighted upon the
bier.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the present day we hear a great deal about
airships; but if we are to believe some of the old folk-stories,
magicians travelled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span>through the air in days long before anyone
had ever dreamt of a balloon. In former times it was believed by the
ignorant that a wizard with his magic book could, and did, summon a
demon in the shape of a horse, and travelled on the back of the fiend
through the air. It is said that Sir Dafydd Llwyd of Ysbytty Ystwyth,
employed a demon for that purpose; and one night when he was riding
home from Montgomeryshire on a demon in the shape of a horse, a boy who
rode behind him on the same horse lost one of his garters on the
journey. After this the boy went to search for his garter, and to his
great surprise saw it on the very top of a tree near the church, which
convinced him that the wizard and himself had been riding home through
the air!</p>
<p class="par">There was also at Llanbadarn Fawr, in the same county,
about seven hundred years ago, a Knight named Sir Dafydd Sion Evan, who
was supposed to be taking journeys through the air on a demon-horse.
This Sir Dafydd was at times absent for weeks; and when he returned he
was often wet with foam and covered with seaweed, or his head and
shoulders sprinkled with snow, during the heat of summer. At other
times he was blackened with smoke and smelling strong of sulphureous
fire. On one occasion when Sir Dafydd had mounted this
&ldquo;devil-born&rdquo; horse, and had gone up a considerable height
into the air, the horse turned his head and said, &ldquo;How I have
forgotten Sir Davy Sion Evan; I asked not of the course of thy travel;
art thou for steering above wind, or below wind&rdquo;? &ldquo;On
Devil-born!&rdquo; said Sir Davy, &ldquo;and stint prate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Such tales of wizards riding through the air on demons
are to be found in Scotland as well as Wales, and Sir Walter Scott in
his Notes to the Lay of the Last Minstrel, gives the following story
concerning Sir Michael Scott, who was chosen, it is said, to go upon an
embassy to obtain from the King of France satisfaction for certain
piracies committed by his subjects upon those of Scotland. Instead of
preparing a new equipage and splendid retinue, the ambassador retreated
to his study, opened his book, and evoked a fiend in the shape of a
huge black horse, mounted upon his back, and forced him to fly through
the air towards France. As they crossed the sea, the devil insidiously
asked his rider what it was that the old women in Scotland muttered at
bedtime? A less experienced wizard might have answered that it was the
Pater Noster, which would have licensed the devil to precipitate him
from his back. But Michael sternly replied, &ldquo;What is that to
thee? Mount Diabolus, and fly!&rdquo; When he arrived at Paris, he tied
his horse to the gate of the palace, entered, and boldly delivered his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>message. An ambassador with so little of the
pomp and circumstances of diplomacy was not received with much respect;
and the King was about to return a contemptuous refusal to his demand,
when Michael besought him to suspend his resolution till he had seen
his horse stamp three times. The first stamp shook every steeple in
Paris, and caused all the bells to ring; the second threw down three of
the towers of the palace; and the infernal steed had lifted his hoof to
give the third stamp, when the King rather chose to dismiss Michael
with the most ample concessions than to stand to the probable
consequences.</p>
<p class="par">It seems that in Eastern countries also, there are
traditions of magicians riding through the air, for in the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; we have the story of the Enchanted
Horse.</p>
<p class="par">An old carpenter, named Benjamin Phillips, Bronwydd
Arms, Carmarthen, informed me the Wizard of Fos-y-Broga, often caused a
demon to appear at night in the form of a white bull, on the road near
Llanpumpsaint.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE HARRIESES OF CWRTYCADNO, THE POPULAR MODERN
WIZARDS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The most popular and greatest wizards of modern
days were undoubtedly the Harrieses of Cwrtycadno, in
Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p class="par">John Harries lived at Pantcoy, Cwrtycadno, in the Parish
of Caio, and died in the year 1839. His sons were also popular
conjurers, one of whom only died about 45 years ago.</p>
<p class="par">Harries was a medical man, an astrologer, and a wizard,
and people came to enquire of his oracle from all parts of Wales, and
from the English borders, especially Herefordshire, and his name was
familiar through the length and breadth of the land. It is said that he
had a wonderful power over lunatics; could cure diseases; charm away
pain; protect people from witches, and foretell future events, etc.
Good many stories are told of him by old people, and I have already
introduced his name in my account of witches.</p>
<p class="par">I was told by an old man, Mr. David Evans, a millwright
from Llandilo, that the popularity of Harries as a wizard originated as
follows:&mdash;A young woman somewhere in that part of the country was
lost, and could not be found after searching for her everywhere; at
last her relations and friends went to Cwrtycadno to consult Dr.
Harries. The wizard informed them that the girl had been murdered by
her sweetheart, and that he had hid her body in the earth, under the
shades of a tree, in the hollow of which they would find a bee&rsquo;s
nest. The tree stood alone near a brook. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>searching party at last came across the spot
indicated by the conjurer, and here they found the young woman&rsquo;s
body buried, as the wise man had told them. The young man who had
murdered the girl was found, and confessed the crime. When the
authorities of the law became aware of these facts, the wizard was
brought before the magistrates, at Llandovery, where he was charged
with knowing and abetting of murder, otherwise he could not have known
she was murdered, and where she was buried. He was, however,
discharged. According to the &ldquo;History of Caio,&rdquo; by F. S.
Price, an interesting book presented to me by Lady Hills-Johnes, the
wizard told the magistrates (Lloyd, Glansevin, and Gwyn, Glanbran),
that if they would tell him the hour they were born, he would tell them
the hour they would die!</p>

believed, and it is still believed by many, that he could and did
summon spirits to appear. A few years ago when I was allowed to search
what is left of the Library of Harries, which is still to be seen at
Pantcoy, where he lived, I found a large number of medical books, and
Greek and Latin works, I also found several books dealing with
astrology, magic art, charms, etc.; but the much talked of padlocked

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;After the manner prescribed by Magicians,
the exorcist must inform himself of the name of his Good Genius, which
he may find in the Rules of the Travins and Philermus; as also, what
Chonactes and Pentacle, or Larim, belongs to every Genius. After this
is done, let him compose an earnest prayer unto the said Genius, which
he must repeat thrice every morning for seven days before the
Invocation.... When the day is come wherein the Magician would invocate
his prayer to Genius he must enter into a private closet, having a
little table and silk carpet, and two waxen candles lighted; as also a
chrystal stone shaped triangularly about the quantity of an apple which
stone must be fixed upon a frame in the centre of the table; and then
proceeding with great devotion to Invocation, he must thrice repeat the
former prayer, concluding the same with Pater Noster, etc., and a
missale de Spiritu Sancto. Then he must begin to consecrate the
candles, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>carpet, table and chrystal, sprinkling the same
with his own blood, and saying: I do by the power of the holy Names
Aglaon, Eloi, Eloi Sabbathon, Anepheraton, Jah, Agian, Jah, Jehovah;
Immanuel, Archon, Archonton, Sadai, Sadai, Jeovaschah, etc., sanctifie
and consecrate these holy utensils to the performance of this holy
work, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Which done,
the Exorcist must say the following prayer with his face towards the
East, and kneeling with his back to the consecrated table:&mdash;O thou
blessed Phanael my angel guardian, vouchsafe to descend with thy holy
influence and presence into this spotless chrystal, that I may behold
thy glory, etc. This prayer being first repeated towards the East, must
be afterwards said towards all the four winds thrice. And next the
<a class="biblink xd24e50" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%2070">70th
Psalm</a> repeated out of a Bible that hath been consecrated in like
manner as the rest of the utensils, which ceremonies being seriously
performed, the Magician must arise from his knees and sit before the
chrystal bareheaded with the consecrated Bible in his hand and the
waxen candle newly lighted waiting patiently and internally for the
coming and appearance of the Genius.... Now about a quarter of an hour
before the spirit come, there will appear great variety of apparitions
within the glass; as first a beaten road or tract, and travellers, men,
and women marching silently along. Next there will be rivers, wells,
mountains, and seas appear, after that, a shepherd upon a pleasant hill
feeding a goodly flock of sheep, and the sun shining brightly at his
going down; and lastly, innumerable flows of birds and beasts, monsters
and strange appearance, and which will all vanish at the appearance of
the Genius.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE FARMER WHO CONSULTED THE CONJUROR; OR THE FAMILIAR
SPIRITS AND THE LOST COWS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A farmer who lived in the Southern part of
Carmarthenshire, lost three cows. Having searched in vain for them
everywhere, he at last went to Cwrt-y-Cadno, though he had a very long
journey to go. When he arrived there and consulted Dr. Harries, the
worthy wizard told him that he could not give him any information
concerning his lost cows till next day, as he wanted time to consult
his magic books. The farmer was a little disappointed, as he wanted to
go home that evening; but under the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>circumstances there
was nothing to be done but try and get a bed for the night at some farm
in the neighbourhood. So he left the wizard for the night with the
intention of returning to him again in the morning, when he hoped to
hear something of his lost cows. But after going out of the house, he
noticed a barn close by, which he entered, and found in a corner a heap
of straw where he thought he could lie down and sleep comfortably till
next morning. This he did unknown to the wizard, who took for granted
that the farmer had gone to stay for the night at some house in the
neighbourhood. He slept comfortably in the barn for a while, but about
one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he was awakened by the sound of the
wizard&rsquo;s footsteps entering the place at that untimely hour, with
a lantern in his hand. The disturbed farmer could not imagine what he
wanted in the barn at this time of the night, and he was afraid of
being discovered. Presently, however, he noticed the conjurer drawing a
circle around himself in the middle of the room; that is the well-known
Wizard&rsquo;s Circle. Then he stood right in the middle of this
circle, and having opened a book, he summoned seven demons or familiar
spirits to appear, and in an instant they came one after another and
stood outside the circle. Then he addressed or called out to the first
spirit something as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Tell me where are the
farmer&rsquo;s lost cows&rdquo;? But the demon answered not. He
repeated the question two or three times, but the Familiar was quite
dumb. At last, however, it shouted out, &lsquo;A pig in the
straw&rsquo; but this was no reply to the wizard&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p class="par">Having failed with the first spirit, the wizard
addressed the second one, and then the third, and so on till he had
given the question to each one of the familiars except one, without any
result; the spirits seemed very stupid on this occasion, and would not
give the information required. Fortunately, however, when the question
was given to the seventh and last of the demons, it shouted out,
&lsquo;The farmer&rsquo;s cows will be on Carmarthen Bridge at 12
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.<span class="corr" id="xd24e6600" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> Then the wizard left the barn and went
to bed well pleased.</p>
<p class="par">The farmer who was hiding in the straw heard everything,
and made up his mind to travel to Carmarthen at once, so as to be there
in time to find his cows on the Bridge. So off he went to Carmarthen,
and reached the Bridge just at 12 o&rsquo;clock, and to his great joy
the cows were there. Then he drove them home, but when he had gone
about half-a-mile from the Bridge, the cows fell down as if half dead
on the roadside, and in vain did he try to get them to move forward any
further. So he had to go all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>way to Cwrt-y-Cadno again, so
as to consult what to do. When he arrived there &ldquo;Serve thee
right,&rdquo; said the wizard to him, &ldquo;I have cast a spell on thy
cattle for running away secretly last night from the barn without
paying me for the information obtained from the spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the farmer gave the wizard a certain sum of money
and returned to his three cows which he had left on the road
half-a-mile from Carmarthen Bridge; and to his great joy the cows went
home without any further trouble.</p>

a visit in the neighbourhood of Cwrtycadno. When he started to return
home it was getting rather late, and he had a long journey to go
through a lonely mountainous country. The wizard, Dr. Harries, asked
him if he was afraid of such a journey over the mountain in the depth
of night. The man confessed that he did not like such a journey at that
late hour without a single soul to accompany him, but that he was
obliged to go home that night without fail; and so he proceeded on his
way. As he journeyed along, the darkness of night overtook him on his
way over the mountain, but to his great surprise, when he looked around
him, he noticed a black dog following him, or rather walking by his
side. The dog was very friendly, and the lonely traveller felt glad of
the animal&rsquo;s company. So on they went together; but when they
were nearing his home the dog vanished suddenly into nothing. The man
was quite convinced that the dog was nothing but a familiar Spirit, in
the shape of a dog, sent by the wizard to bear him company in his
lonely night journey.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Harries, Cwrtycadno, had a magic glass, so it is
said, into which a person looked when he wished to know or see the
woman he was to marry. A young man named Phillips, once had gone from
the parish of Llanllawddog, to Cwrtycadno, to show Dr. Harries some of
his father&rsquo;s urine, which he took with him in a small bottle, as
the old man was very ill. Harries examined it, and told the young man
that his father would never get well again. The young man now decided
to return home as soon as he could through Abergorlech, and Brechfa,
where he intended staying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>for the night, as the journey was
a long one. Just before he departed, however, Harries asked him,
&ldquo;By the way young man, would you like me to tell your fortune?
I&rsquo;ll do it for 2s. 6d.&rdquo;; and so it was agreed. The conjurer
had a large looking glass, the Magician&rsquo;s Glass, which was
covered with a large board. He took off this covering, and told the
young man to look into the glass. so as to see his future wife. He did
look stedfastly as he was directed, and saw in the glass the form of a
young woman passing by. Meanwhile, the wizard himself had entered alone
into a little side room, where he was speaking loudly to a familiar
Spirit, or something; but he soon returned to the young man and asked
him, &ldquo;Did you see anything in the glass?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I saw
a young woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you know her?&rdquo; &ldquo;No. I had
never seen her before: she was a perfect stranger to me.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the conjurer, &ldquo;whether you have met her
or not, that young woman you saw in the glass is to be your future
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Sometime after this, the young man and his brother, both
being carpenters, were one day working on the roof of a house which had
been damaged by a storm, and it so happened that some woman and her
daughter, who were passing by, came to speak to them. When the women
had gone away out of hearing, the young man, who had been to
Cwrtycadno, said to his brother in surprise: &ldquo;That young girl was
the very one I saw in the Wizard&rsquo;s Magic Glass.&rdquo; This was
their first acquaintance, and by and by they were married. My informant
was their own son who is a carpenter, and lives about a mile from
Bronwydd Arms Station, in Carmarthenshire. His name is Benjamin

years ago that on one occasion, long ago, when a baby, a girl, was born
to him and his wife, he went to Dr. Harries, Cwrtycadno, to consult him
about the future destiny of the child. The conjurer spoke to him
something as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I hope you will not be distressed
when you hear what is going to happen to your dear child; but the truth
of it is, she will have a very narrow escape from drowning at the age
of four, and death awaits her at the age of twenty!&rdquo; My informant

place exactly as Harries told him. His dear girl at the age of four one
day, whilst playing and running along the river side (River Cothy),
fell over the banks into the water and nearly got drowned. After this,
she never enjoyed good health, and at the age of twenty she died!</p>

several other men accompanied him there, and one of them was named John
Lloyd, who was a perfect stranger to Dr. Harries. But the wise man
through his knowledge of the occult science, was able to tell this
stranger that he had a mole on his head, and had met with an accident
on his leg, which was true. My informant also added that the wizard
&ldquo;set great importance on the Planet under which a man was
born.&rdquo;</p>

find it, so he went to Cwrtycadno, to consult Dr. Harries about it. The
Conjurer told him where to find the money, and warned him to keep away
from fairs, lest some accident should befall him. Wiliam was very
careful for a time, but at last a son of his got married, and persuaded
him to accompany him to a fair at Lampeter. He went, and was thrown
down by a horse, and died in a few days.</p>

HENRY VII.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the Earl of Richmond (afterwards Henry VII.)
was about to land in Wales from France on his way to Bosworth, Sir Rhys
Ap Thomas, consulted a well-known wizard and prophet, who dwelt at
Dale, as to whether the Earl would be successful to dethrone Richard
III. After much hesitation, and at the urgent demand of Sir Rhys, the
Conjurer on the next day prophesied in rhyme as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Full well I wend, that in the end</p>

<h3 class="main">THE CONJURER AND THE LOST OX.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. Thomas Jones, Brunant Arms, Caio, gave me the
following account of what took place about 55 years ago, when his
father lived at Penlifau, in the parish of Cilcwm, on the mountain
side, and near the road which leads over the mountain from Cilcwm to
Cwmcothi. A young farmer who lived at a place called Foshwyaid, Cwm Du,
near Talley, has taken some cattle to Caio fair, in the month of
August. Somehow or other, one of his oxen went astray from the Fair,
and could not be seen anywhere in the neighbourhood. The young farmer
and others went in every direction in search of the animal, but
returned disappointed. At last, the man went to Cwrtycadno, to consult
the &ldquo;Dyn Hysbys.&rdquo; The wise man informed him that his ox had
wandered away from the Fair, at first in a northernly, and afterwards
in an easterly direction, &ldquo;and&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you take
the road leading from here over the mountain to Cilcwm, you will meet a
man (the conjurer gave a description of the man) who is likely to know
something, or at least give you some clue to your lost animal.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The young farmer then went on his way, and after
proceeding for some distance, he did meet a man as the conjurer had
told him, and he told him all his troubles. Now this very man happened
to be my informant&rsquo;s father who lived close by. Mr. Jones
sympathised very much with the young farmer, and though a stranger,
invited him home with him to get something to eat, and he accordingly
went, and at the house, they talked together for some time. At last,
the young farmer had to proceed again on his journey, rather
disappointed, as his new friend who had showed every kindness, could
give him no information about his lost ox. Jones went with him for a
short distance, just to show him a path (a short cut) leading from the
house to the road; and after bidding each other farewell, they parted.
But before the young farmer had gone far, Jones called him back, and
informed him that he had just recollected hearing some men, when coming
home from Cilcwm Church last Sunday, talking together about some new ox
which they had not noticed before in the field or yard of Tim. Davies,
Gweungreuddyn (a path from the Church went close by T. D.&rsquo;s
farm). When he heard this bit of news from Jones, off he went at once
as fast as he could go to Mr. Timothy Davies; and to his great joy,
when he arrived there, found his stray animal quite safe in the
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">ffald</span>.&rdquo; The local authorities had
discovered the ox wandering about the country; but before the young
farmer was allowed to take his animal home with him, the sum of seven
shillings was to be paid for faldage. The young man went back to Jones,
obtained the loan of seven shillings which he repaid honestly after
arriving home with his ox.</p>
<p class="par">My informant also added that the conjurer had addressed
the same young farmer as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;My poor fellow, you are
in great sorrow,&rdquo; &ldquo;No&rdquo; said the farmer,
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; said the conjurer again, <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6721" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>you have buried your
mother a few weeks ago.&rdquo; The man then confessed that this was
quite true. The wise man added, &ldquo;A more melancholy event still
awaits you at the end of twelve months.&rdquo; And at the end of twelve
months the young farmer himself died!</p>
<p class="par">Watkin Evans, Blaenpark, informed me that a farmer in
the parish of Dihewyd, Cardiganshire, found a harrow which he had lost
by consulting a conjurer.</p>
<p class="par">One John Evans, of Llanddarog, in Carmarthenshire, 85

<h3 class="main">THE CONJURER AND THE LOST HORSE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An old farmer, Mr. David Pugh, Erwlwyd, near Caio,
Carmarthenshire, told me the following story a few years ago, and
vouched for the truth of it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">A friend of Mr. Pugh had lost a horse, and after
searching in vain for the animal for a whole fortnight, he was at last
advised to go to consult the &ldquo;Dyn Hysbys.&rdquo; He rather
hesitated at first, but he, however, went. The man was a farmer in the
neighbourhood of Llandovery, but my informant did not wish to mention
his name. The Wizard, Harries, of Cwrtycadno, consulted his oracles,
but did not know what reply to give to the farmer at first about his
animal. &ldquo;Do tell me&rdquo; said the farmer most earnestly,
&ldquo;what has become of my horse, or who has taken away the animal?
It is such a loss to me to lose such a fine steed.&rdquo; Presently,
the wizard informed him that a certain man (whom he described) had
found the horse on the road, and caught the animal and tied him to a
tree which was close by. After a while, this stranger took him home
quietly and closed him in his own stable, fully making up his mind to
sell the horse at the first opportunity. &ldquo;And I am almost certain
he&rsquo;ll succeed in doing so,&rdquo; added the conjurer, &ldquo;I am
afraid you&rsquo;ll never see your horse again.<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6736" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;Can you do
something to prevent the thief selling my horse&rdquo;? asked the
farmer. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the wizard. The wise man then took
some paper or parchment on which he inscribed some magic word, or
words, and gave it to the farmer, telling him that so long as the
parchment was kept safely in his pocket, the thief could not succeed in
selling the horse at the fair. &ldquo;But what can I do to find my
stolen horse&rdquo;? &ldquo;Watch on the road next Friday, near
Glanbran, and I feel almost certain that you will And your horse before
the day is over, grazing on the roadside somewhere in that
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The farmer then departed with the magic paper safely in
his pocket, and when Friday came, he watched on the road, and to his
great joy and surprise, he found the horse near Glanbran. Just as he
mounted the animal to go home, a young man who passed by, told him that
a few days ago, he had seen this very horse offered on sale at Rhayader
fair, but that the man who was trying to sell him failed to do so!</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mr. Walter Evans (Pentre-Richard), in the Parish
of Llanddewi Brefi, informed me a few years ago, before he died, that
some years ago, when he lost some sheep, a conjurer who lived on
Llanfair mountain, directed or pointed out to him where to find them,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>and that they were found two days afterwards in
some water nearly drowning as the wise man had said. This Llanfair
Clydogau conjurer only died about nine years ago, and until he died
people consulted him from the surrounding districts of Cardiganshire
and Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p class="par">The best service rendered by conjurers to society was to
help people to discover thieves, and the superstitious often restored
what they had stolen through fear.</p>
<p class="par">On one occasion a man who was often losing potatoes from
the field went to Harries, Cwrtycadno, who was a terror to thieves. The
conjurer showed him the thief in a magic glass, which enabled the man
to discover who the culprit was. In another potato tale, the wise man,
by means of his magic art forced the thief to appear at his house and
confess his guilt.</p>

<p class="par first">Mr. Griffiths, of &lsquo;Rhenallt, an old farmer
near Carmarthen, informed me about six years ago that long ago when he
was a young man, he was once a servant at Alltyferin. Ducks were
continually lost at the farm, and his master who suspected a neighbour
as the thief, sent Griffiths with a letter to a conjurer who lived at
Fosybroga. The wise man sent a note in reply giving a full description
of the thief, and he was caught.</p>
<p class="par">A woman in Pembrokeshire, who had lost a most valuable
picture, consulted a well-known wizard, who showed her a picture of the
thief in a magic glass. She recognised the culprit at once as one of
her intimate friends. The wizard then wrote the name of the thief on a
piece of paper, and pierced it with a needle, and informed his client
that if the picture was not restored to her within half an hour the
thief would be eaten up of a strange disease.</p>

<h3 class="main">WIZARD MARKING THE CULPRITS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It was believed in Cardiganshire and
Carmarthenshire, that Harries, Cwrtycadno, could mark out thieves, and
also persons who had an &ldquo;Evil Eye,&rdquo; by causing a horn to
grow out of their foreheads. A man in Tregaron had witched a woman, but
the conjurer marked the mischievous person by putting a horn on his
head.</p>
<p class="par">A farmer from the parish of Llangwyryfon, in
Cardiganshire, whose cattle had been witched by a neighbour who had an
evil eye, went to Llangurig in Montgomeryshire, to consult, a
well-known conjurer who only died a few years ago. The Wizard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>for the payment of 10s. showed a picture of the
offender in a magic mirror, and offered to cause him to die of a
strange disease. The farmer begged the conjurer not to do that; that he
did not desire to kill his enemy, only to punish him, and he was
punished. My informant was a farmer who lives near Talybont,
Cardiganshire.</p>
<p class="par">This Llangurig wizard was continually consulted by
clients from Montgomeryshire, Cardiganshire, Radnorshire, and other
counties. Not long ago, there was also a conjurer at Llanidloes, in the
same county (Montgomeryshire), who was consulted on all cases of cursed
fields, bewitched cattle, horses, pigs, churns, backward lovers,
bewitched women, etc.</p>

<h3 class="main">A WIZARD AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN CURSED.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An old man named Evan Morris, who lives at
Goginan, near Aberystwyth, informed me that about 60 years ago, a young
man in that neighbourhood was struck dumb all of a sudden, that he
could not utter a word. As he had neither been ill nor met with an
accident it was suspected that he had been witched by some neighbour.
So his father at last went over the mountain to Llangurig, about twenty
miles off, to consult a well-known wizard named &ldquo;Savage.&rdquo;
The wizard opened his magic book, from which out came a big fly,
buzzing or making a humming noise, boom, boom, boom, near the
conjurer&rsquo;s face, who exclaimed, &ldquo;What is the matter with
this old fly?&rdquo; The wise man then struck the insect with his hand
and commanded it back into the book, and closed the volume; but he
opened it again at another page, and out came another fly of a
different colour. This fly again was buzzing till the wizard commanded
it back into the book, which he now closed altogether; and addressing
the man who had come to consult him, said to him: &ldquo;You have
suspected a certain man in your neighbourhood of having witched your
son; but you are wrong; another man whom you do not suspect is the
guilty. But your son has not been witched at all; he is under a
curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Welsh conjurers made a distinction between witchcraft
and a curse. Thomas Jones, of Pontrhydfendigaid, informed me that a
conjurer at Llangurig, named Morgans, told him once, that some men who
were born under certain planets, possessed an inherent power of
cursing, &ldquo;and their curse,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is worse than
witchcraft itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When the man returned home from the conjurer, to his
great joy and surprise, he found his son able to speak. My informant
vouches for the truth of the story, and added that this conjurer was so
deep in the Black Art that he could do almost anything. <span class=

<h3 class="main">MERLIN.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I have in the preceding pages given some instances
of modern and medi&aelig;val magicians or wizards; but divination
astrology and magic in this country are of very ancient date. The names
of Idris Gawr, Gwyddion, the Diviner by Trees, and Gwyn, the son of
Nud, have come down to us from prehistoric times. So great was these
three&rsquo;s knowledge of the stars, that they could foretell whatever
might be desired to know until the day of doom. In Welsh Mythology,
several even of the kingly families are represented as playing the role
of magicians, especially Rhiannon, the daughter of Heveydd Hen. Math Ap
Mathonwy, King of Gwynedd, could form a maiden out of flowers, and
transform men into deers and wolves, etc. But, perhaps, the greatest of
all the wizards was Myrddin, or Merlin as he is known among English
readers, who lived about the beginning of the sixth century. Myrddin
was born in the neighbourhood of Carmarthen, or at least so it is
believed; and it is also believed that the meaning of Carmarthen is
Myrddin&rsquo;s town, and the people of Carmarthen to this day feel
proud of such a famous prophet who was born in their town. Merlin (or
Myrddin)&rsquo;s fame spread throughout all the Western parts of
Europe, if not to other parts of the world, and his mighty magic
adorned the tales of romance, and in the tenth century one eminent
scholar on the Continent, went as far as to write, a commentary on his
prophecies or prognostications. But to confine ourselves to Welsh
writers, we have some account of Merlin by Nennius in the eighth
century, and by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth.</p>
<p class="par">Geoffrey says:&mdash;&ldquo;Vortigern, after the
infamous treachery of the long knives, retreated to Mount
Erir&mdash;which is Eryri, or snowden&mdash;and here he ordered the
building of a great tower of defence, whose foundations, however, were
swallowed up by the earth as fast as they were filled in.&rdquo; The
Magicians, on hearing this, said he must procure the blood of &ldquo;a
youth that never had a father,&rdquo; and sprinkle it on the stones and
mortar. Vortigern, accordingly, sent messengers to different parts of
the country in search of such a youth; and &ldquo;in their travels they
came to a city, called, afterwards, Caermerdin, where they saw some
young men playing before the gate, and went up to them; but being weary
with their journey, they sat them down there.... Towards evening, there
happened on a sudden a quarrel between two of the young men, whose
names were Merlin and Dalbutius. In the dispute, Dalbutius said to
Merlin, &lsquo;As for you, nobody knows what you are, for you never had
a father.&rsquo; At that word the messengers looked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>earnestly upon Merlin, and asked who he was.
They learnt it was not known who was his father, but that his mother
was daughter to the King of Dimetia, and that she lived in St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, among the nuns of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Merlin and his mother at the request of the messengers
accompanied them from Carmarthen to Snowdon to the presence of King
Vortigern; and when the boy was asked who was his father, his mother in
reply gave a very peculiar account of the birth of her son, whose
father she declared was a supernatural being, and so had no human
father. Then the King said to Merlin, &ldquo;I must have thy
blood.&rdquo; And when the youth asked the King what good could his
blood be more than the blood of any other man, he was informed in reply
that the twelve wise men or bards had suggested the blood of a youth in
order to make the building stand. Then Merlin asked the bards or
magicians what was the real cause that the building of the tower was
not a success? But they could give no answer. Young Merlin now upraided
them for their ignorance and the cruelty of their suggestion. He then
gave orders to dig the ground, and when this was done a lake was
discovered. Merlin drained this lake, and at the bottom, as he had
predicted, a stone chest was discovered in which there were two
sleeping dragons. These, whenever they awoke, fought with each other,
and their violence shook the ground, thus causing &ldquo;the work to
fall.&rdquo; When the King commanded the stone chest to be opened the
two dragons came out and began a fierce battle. One of these dragons
was white and the other red. At first the white dragon drove the red
one to the middle of the pool, then the red one, provoked to rage,
drove the white one thither in turn. When the King asked what this
should signify, Merlin exclaimed as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Woe to the
red dragon for her calamity draws nigh, and the white dragon shall
seize on her cells. By the white dragon the Saxons are signified, and
the Britons by the red one, which the white shall overcome. Then shall
the mountains be made plains, and the glens and rivers flow with blood.
The Saxons shall possess almost all the island from sea to sea, and
afterwards our nation shall arise, and bravely drive the Saxons beyond
the sea.&rdquo; Nennius, chap. 43.</p>
<p class="par">The old King Vortigern then left the neighbourhood of
Snowdon, and removed to South Wales, and built a fort or a Castle on a
spot known to this day as Craig Gwrtheyrn, or Vortigern&rsquo;s Rock,
near Llandyssul and Pencader.</p>
<p class="par">The white and the red dragons respectively symbolised
the Celtic and Saxon races, and Merlin&rsquo;s prophecy concerning the
final overthrow of the Saxons by the Britons made a deep and lasting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>impression on the minds of the Welsh people for
ages, and even nearly nine hundred years after Merlin&rsquo;s time.
Owen Glyndwr found these prophecies highly instrumental in his favour
when fighting against the English. According to a little book which I
have in my possession entitled, &ldquo;Prophwydoliaeth Myrddin
Wyllt,&rdquo; (Merlin&rsquo;s prophecy), one Owen Lawgoch, who is
tarrying in a foreign land, is to drive out the Saxons, and become King
under the title of Henry the ninth. Welshmen of the present day,
however, believe that Merlin&rsquo;s prophecy was fulfilled in the year
1485, when Henry VII., a Welshman leading a Welsh army to Bosworth
Field, became King of England.</p>
<p class="par">There are also many prophecies here and there attributed
to Merlin; some of which have been fulfilled, and others to be
fulfilled in the future. He had foretold even of the railway train
running along the Vale of Towy, which prediction has proved true:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fe ddaw y gath a&rsquo;r wenci ar hyd Glan Towi

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The cat and the weasel shall come down along the
banks of Towy;</p>
<p class="line">The greyhound and the fox shall come into the town of
Aber honddu,&rdquo; (Brecon).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">It is believed that the train has fulfilled these
sayings.</p>
<p class="par">In the Vale of Towy, near Abergwili, there is a large
stone in a field belonging to Tyllwyd farm. I went to see it myself,
and several people in the neighbourhood informed me that a young man
was killed when digging under this stone in search of hidden treasure,
and that Merlin had prophesied about this.</p>
<p class="par">According to another prophecy of Merlin a fearful
catastrophe awaits the town of Carmarthen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Llanllwch a fu,</p>
<p class="line">Caerfyrddin a sudd,</p>

<p class="line">Earth shall swallow thee, water into thy place).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">The people of the neighbourhood even to this very
day, more than half believe that Carmarthen is to sink. At the end of a
long street in that town there is an old tree known as Merlin&rsquo;s
Tree, in a very withered condition. Every care is taken to protect
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=

when this tree shall tumble down, the town of Carmarthen shall

<p class="par">According to another prophecy attributed to the same
ancient wizard, Carmarthen is to sink when Llyn Eiddwen, a lake in
Cardiganshire, dries up.</p>
<p class="par">It is said that Merlin had predicted that a bull would
go right to the top of the tower of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church,
Carmarthen, and that a calf fulfilled this prophecy.</p>
<p class="par">My cousin, the Rev. Joseph Evans, the Rector of
Jordanston, in Pembrokeshire, informed me a few years ago that one mile
from the town of Fishguard, there is a farm called Tregroes, respecting
which Merlin prophesied that it would be in the middle of the town some
day. There are now signs that this ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>prophecy is likely to be fulfilled. September
4th, 1909, the Royal Mail Ship, Mauretania, the finest and fastest
liner afloat, inaugurated the new <span class="corr" id="xd24e6869"
title="Source: Translantic">Transatlantic</span> Service from New York
to Fishguard, so that there is a great future before the place as
indicated by Merlin of old. It is also interesting to note that the
captain of the Mauretania was a Welshman (Pritchard), and the first
passenger to land was also a Welshman, named Mr. Jenkin Evans, brother
to the Rector of Jordanston.</p>
<p class="par">I have been informed that a relation of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, lives at this very house respecting which Merlin had
prophesied.</p>
<p class="par">General Gwynne, a fine old gentleman I met a short time

wrote to me as follows respecting another remarkable prophecy of Merlin
and its fulfilment:&mdash;</p>

Glanbran until a man standing at Dover could speak to another at
Calais. Years after, when I was in India, about the year when the
telephone or telegraph was perfected between France and England, a

<p class="par">According to Giraldus Cambrensis, Merlin had prophesied
that a King of England and Conqueror of Ireland, should die in crossing
&ldquo;Llechllafar,&rdquo; a stone of great size which was placed
across the stream dividing the cemetery of St. David&rsquo;s from the
north side of the Church to form a bridge. When Henry II. passed over
it on his return from Ireland a frantic woman called upon Llechllafar
to kill him according to Merlin&rsquo;s prophecy.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The King, who had heard the prophecy, approaching
tie stone, stopped for a short time at the foot of it, and, looking
earnestly at it, boldly passed over; then, turning round, and looking
towards the stone, thus indignantly inveighed against the <span class=

title="Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>Who will hereafter give credit to
the lying Merlin?&rsquo; A person standing by, and observing what had
passed, in order to vindicate the injury done to the prophet, replied,
with a loud voice, &lsquo;Thou art not that King of whom Ireland is to
be conquered, or of whom Merlin prophesied!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">According to an ancient tradition, this stone spoke or
groaned once when a corpse was carried over it.</p>
<p class="par">I was informed by many persons who live in the
neighbourhood of Abergwili, near Carmarthen, that Merlin was such a
giant that he could jump over the Vale of Towy.</p>

<h3 class="main">MERLIN&rsquo;S FATE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The end or final fate of Merlin is surrounded by
mysteries. A few years ago when I was staying in the neighbourhood of
Carmarthen, Merlin&rsquo;s Hill (Bryn Myrddin) was pointed out to me
where the great magician still lives (so they say) in a cave in that
hill, and held there in imprisonment by an artful woman who contrived
his disappearance from among human beings. Moreover, it is added, that
if you listen in the twilight, you will hear his groans, and also the
clanking of the iron chains which hold him bound. Others say he is
heard working in this underground prison<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6914" title="Not in source">.</span></p>
<p class="par">It seems from Spenser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faerie
Queen,&rdquo; however, that according to another ancient tradition,
Merlin&rsquo;s place of confinement is, or was, a cave near Dynevor, in
the neighbourhood of Llandilo:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And if you ever happen that same way to traveill,
go to see that dreadful place. It is an hideous hollow cave (they say)
under a rock that lyes a little apace emongst the woody hilles of
Dynevowre (Dynevor), etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some stories describe Merlin as being held spellbound in
a bush of white thorns in the woods of Bresilien in Brittany. Others
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>say that he died, and was buried at Bardsey
Island. But according to the Triads he went to sea and sailed in a
house of glass, and was never heard of any more. In this voyage, Merlin
took with him the thirteen curiosities of Britain, which
were:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. <span lang="cy">Llen Arthur</span> (the veil of
Arthur), which made the person who put it on invisible.</p>
<p class="par">2. <span lang="cy">Dyrnwyn</span>.</p>

Brangaled), which furnished any liquor desired.</p>
<p class="par">4. <span lang="cy">Cadair, neu car Morgan
mwynfawr</span> (the chair or car of Morgan Mwynfawr), which would
carry a person seated in it wherever he wished to go.</p>
<p class="par">5. <span lang="cy">Mwys Gwyddno</span> (the hamper of
Gwyddno), meat for one being put into it, would become meat for a
hundred.</p>
<p class="par">6. <span lang="cy">Hogalen Tudno</span> (the whetstone
of Tudno), which would sharpen none but the weapon of a brave man.</p>
<p class="par">7. <span lang="cy">Pais Padarn</span> (the cloak of
Padarn).</p>
<p class="par">8. <span lang="cy">Pair Drynog</span> (the caldron of
Drynog), none but the meat of a brave man would boil in it.</p>
<p class="par">9. <span lang="cy">Dysgyl a gren Rhydderch</span> (the
dish and platter of Rhydderch), any meat desired would appear on
it.</p>
<p class="par">10. <span lang="cy">Tawlbwrdd</span> (a chess board, or,
rather backgammon board), the ground gold, and the men silver, and the
men would play themselves.</p>
<p class="par">11. <span lang="cy">Mantell</span> (a robe).</p>

<h3 class="main">PEMBROKESHIRE WOMAN&rsquo;S PROPHECY FULFILLED.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The following appeared in the &ldquo;Pembrokeshire
County Guardian&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;About one hundred and sixty years ago,
there lived on a farm near Spittal in Pembrokeshire, a man of the name
of David Evans. He had a family of five children: Thomas, the eldest,
was born on November 3, 1756, and married Sarah Bevan, of Martel Mill,
on Sunday, November 14, 17&mdash;, and they lived on a small farm near
Trefgarn Rocks, called Penyfeidr. This Sarah Bevan, or Mrs. Evans was,
like her husband, noted for her piety, and among her neighbours was
possibly more noted for her visions and her ability to foresee and
foretell coming events, of which there are many reliable records still
existing and talked of in the district to this day. Entering the house
one day, she told those present that she had just seen a most
remarkable sight below the house in Trefgarn Valley, and described it
as a large number of heavily laden carts or waggons going very fast one
after the other, and no bullock or horses drawing them, but the first
one appeared from the smoke she saw, to be on fire. George Stephenson
was the first to introduce steam locomotive power into practical use in
the year 1825. So we may state with certainty that the rustics of
Pembrokeshire had no idea or knowledge whatever of the railway train at
the time that Mrs. Evans saw the vision. About 54 years ago the railway
was brought into Pembrokeshire, and the scheme of the great engineer,
Brunel, was to extend it to the sea shore near Fishguard. With this in
view, much work was accomplished in cuttings and embankments in
Trefgarn Valley, which are now to be seen there. The country people
were jubilant, expecting soon to realise the prophetic vision. But
strong influence was brought to bear on Brunel, and finally he
abandoned that route and took the line to New Milford instead. And the
vision and prophecy came to nought. Afterwards the old people looked
forward to the joining of Fishguard and Goodwick with the main line,
and believed the truth of the story. But, alas! when the branch line
was made, it was many miles to the North of Trefgarn, and the old lady
and her vision were once more ridiculed, and apparently, there were no
further grounds for hoping that the prophecy would be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e7010" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>When the project of the G. W. Ry. Co. got
matured, it was found that the old loop line via<a id="xd24e7013" name=
"xd24e7013"></a> Letterston was not suitable for a fast and direct
service from Goodwick to London. So it was decided to make a new line
from Goodwick through Trefgarn Valley,&mdash;thus re-adopting
Brunel&rsquo;s original scheme. And last <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>week I actually saw
&lsquo;a large number of heavily laden carts or waggons going very
fast, one after the other, and no bullocks or horses pulling them, but
the first one appeared from the smoke I saw, to be on fire.&rsquo; Just
as described, and in the very spot indicated by Mrs. Evans about 100
years ago.</p>

<p class="par">The people of Pembrokeshire have been remarkable for
their insight into the future; navvies were heard making railway
cuttings many years before the introduction of steam locomotive power
into practical use.</p>
<p class="par">I have been informed that the sound of a railway engine,
whistling, was heard at Llanilar, in Cardiganshire, fifty years before
a railway was constructed through the neighbourhood; and it is also
said that the sound of blasting was heard at Tyngraig, between Ystrad
Meurig and Llanafan, where afterwards a tunnel was made. My informants
were Mrs. Lloyd, the Vicarage, Llanilar, and Mr. Jones, Tyncoed.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">About six months before the outbreak of the
Crimean War, in 1853, John Meyler, Cilciffeth, saw a strange mirage in
the sky. He was returning home late from Morville, and when nearing
Penterwin he saw the image of armies in the skies. There were several
battalions at first, and they increased in number till they spanned the
heavens. There were two opposing forces, and he could distinctly see
the image of men falling and of horses galloping across the firmament,
and the clashing of great masses of men. He was so terrified that he
called at Penbank and called the attention of Mr. James Morris, who
lived at that place at that time, and he saw the same thing. This
strange phenomenon appeared for about two hours.</p>
<p class="par">The above account of this strange vision in the skies
appeared in the &ldquo;Cardiff Times,&rdquo; a few years ago, sent to
that paper by Cadrawd. Pembrokeshire has always been known as the land
of phantasm.</p>

<p class="par first">In the Churchyard of Montgomery is a grave where
the grass refuses to grow, though it is in the midst of luxurious
vegetation. The unfortunate man named John Newton, who was buried there
in the year 1821, had predicted this as a proof that he was innocent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274</a>]</span>of the charge brought against him at the
Assizes, when he was condemned to die on the evidence of two men named
Thomas Pearce, and Robert Parker, who charged him with highway robbery.
On being asked at the trial why judgment should not be passed upon him,
he said before the judge: &ldquo;I venture to assert that as I am
innocent of the crime for which I suffer, the grass, for one generation
at least, will not cover my grave.&rdquo; The poor man&rsquo;s
prediction proved true, for the grave to this day remains a bare
spot.</p>

the spot. At the head of the grave is the stem of a rose tree, and it
is said that the man who put it there soon fell sick and died. I had
heard of this grave even when I was a boy, and some account of the
story respecting it has appeared in the papers from time to time.

<h3 class="main">SHOULDER-BLADE DIVINATION.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Giraldus Cambrensis, seven hundred years ago,
speaking of the Flemings of South Pembrokeshire, in his
&ldquo;Itinerary through Wales,&rdquo; says:&mdash;&ldquo;It is worthy
of remark, that these people, from the inspection of the right shoulder
of rams which have been stripped of their flesh, and not roasted, but
boiled, can discover future events, or those which have passed and
remained long unknown. They know, also, what is transpiring at a
distant place, by a wonderful art, and a prophetic kind of spirit. They
declare also undoubted symptoms of approaching peace and war, murders
and fires, domestic adulteries, the state of the King, his life and
death. It happened in our time, that a man of those parts, whose name
was William Mangunel, a person of high rank, and excelling all others
in the aforesaid art, had a wife big with child by her own
husband&rsquo;s grandson. Well aware of the fact, he ordered a ram from
his own flock to be sent to his wife as a present from her neighbour;
which was carried to the cook and dressed<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e7059" title="Source: :">.</span> At dinner the husband purposely
gave the shoulder bone of the ram, properly cleaned, to his wife, who
was also well skilled in this art, for her examination; when, having
for a short time examined the secret marks, she smiled, and threw the
oracle down on the table. Her husband dissembling, earnestly demanded
the cause of her smiling and the explanation of the matter<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e7062" title="Not in source">;</span> overcome by his
entreaties, she answered<span class="corr" id="xd24e7065" title=
"Not in source">,</span> &lsquo;The man to whose flock this ram belongs
has an adulterous wife, at this time pregnant by the commission of
incest with his own grandson.&rsquo; The husband, with a sorrowful and
dejected countenance, replied, &lsquo;You deliver indeed an oracle
supported by too much truth, which I have so much more reason to
lament, as the ignominy you have published redounds to my own
injury.<span class="corr" id="xd24e7068" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> The woman thus detected, was unable to
dissemble her confusion, betrayed the inward feelings of her mind by
external signs; shame and sorrow urging her by turns, and manifesting
themselves, now by blushes, now by paleness, and lastly (according to
the custom of women), by tears.</p>
<p class="par">The shoulder of a goat was also once brought to a
certain person instead of a ram&rsquo;s, both being alike when cleaned,
who, observing for a short time the lines and marks, exclaimed
&lsquo;Unhappy cattle that never was multiplied! Unhappy likewise the
owner of the cattle, who never had more than three or four in one
flock!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">Many persons, a year and a half before the event,
foresaw by the means of the shoulder bones the destruction of their
country after the decease of King Henry the First, and selling all
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>possessions, left their homes, and escaped the
impending ruin. In our time, a soothsayer, on the inspection of a bone,
discovered not only a theft, and the manner of it, but the thief
himself, and all the attendant circumstances; he heard also the
striking of a bell, and the sound of a trumpet, as if those things
which were past were still performing. It is wonderful, therefore, that
these bones, like all unlawful conjurations, should represent by a
counterfeit similitude to the eyes and ears, things which are past as
well as those which are now going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It is evident that the Celts, as well as the Flemings,
knew something of Shoulder-bone Reading, for J. G. Campbell, in his
&ldquo;Superstitions of the Scottish Highlands,&rdquo; an interesting
book presented to me by Countess Amherst, states that this mode of
divination was practised, like the augury of the ancients, as a
profession or trade; and Pennant, in his &ldquo;Tours in
Scotland,&rdquo; 150 years ago, says that when Lord Loudon was obliged
to retreat before the Rebels to the Isle of <span class="corr" id=
"xd24e7079" title="Source: Skie">Skye</span>, a common soldier, on the
very moment the battle of Culloden was decided, proclaimed the victory
at a distance, pretending to have discovered the event by looking
through the bone; and Sir S. R. Meyrick, in his &ldquo;History of
Cardiganshire,&rdquo; writing one hundred years ago, says that the
remains of this custom still existed in Cardiganshire in his time;
&ldquo;but the principal use made of the bone is in the case of
pregnant women. The shoulder bone of a ram being scraped quite clean, a
hole is burnt in it, and it is then placed over the door of the
apartment in which the pregnant woman is, and she is told that the sex
of her offspring will be precisely the same as that of the first person
who shall enter the room.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">DREAMS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A dream was a common way of making known the will
of God to the prophets of old. We know from the Bible that important
dreams took place in the early ages of the world, and Welsh people,
like other nations, believe in the importance of these mysterious night
visions, and of their power of forecasting the future, and there are
both men and women all over the country who can give instances of
dreams which came true. There are, undoubtedly, some persons whose
dreams, as a rule, are reliable; whilst the dreams of others are not to
be depended on. It is also said that morning twilight dreams are more
reliable than other dreams; and it is believed that a dream which is
repeated is more to be relied on than that which occurs only once. I
have had most striking dreams myself; indeed almost everything that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>happens to me has been presaged by a dream.
About nine years ago I dreamed that I was delivering a lecture to a
large audience, and speaking most fluently. On awaking, I had a
distinct recollection of every word I had uttered; and I am now very
sorry that I did not write down next morning the lecture which I had
delivered in my dream. The most remarkable fact is this: Previous to my
dream I had no knowledge whatever of the subject on which I lectured,
as I had never studied the subject in my life, and as a psychological
curiosity I may mention that by means of my dream I had become
possessed of knowledge on a particular subject which would have taken
me at least a whole month&rsquo;s hard study to acquire. (I am, of
course, used to public speaking).</p>
<p class="par">I have taken notes of few of my latest dreams, and
perhaps it would not be out of place to record here a remarkable dream
which I dreamt just before this book was going to press:</p>
<p class="par">One night in January, 1910, I dreamed that I was walking
near St. Bride&rsquo;s, the country seat of Lord Kensington, in
Pembrokeshire, and I met Lord Kensington himself, who spoke to me thus:
&ldquo;Go into the house, Lady Kensington is home, and I&rsquo;ll be
with you in a few minutes.&rdquo; Then I went to the door and rang the
bell, and the butler took me into the drawing-room. After waiting in
the room alone for some time without seeing anyone, all the household
servants came to me in a group, dressed in their holiday attire, and
informed me that Lady Kensington was not home after all, but that her
Ladyship had gone away and had got lost somewhere in going about, and
that Lord Kensington was seeking in vain for her everywhere, but
failing to find her anywhere. When I awoke from my dream I felt certain
that something had happened to one of the Kensingtons. A day or two
after my dream I was surprised to read in the papers that a cable-gram
was received in London from Calcutta, announcing the death of Dowager
Lady Kensington in India. I discovered that her death took place on the
very date of my dream, and that a few days previously Lord Kensington
had hurriedly left for India, having received news of the
Dowager&rsquo;s serious condition.</p>
<p class="par">In order to add to the interest of the dream, I may
state that the very day before I dreamt, I expected every moment to
hear of the Dowager&rsquo;s return to England, as her Ladyship knew one
or two interesting &ldquo;traditions of Bridget of Ireland, known as
St. Bride,&rdquo; which she intended to write down for me in order to
record them in this book, to which she was looking forward, as she was
greatly interested in Welsh traditions, especially those of
Pembrokeshire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">One night, about seventeen years ago, when I was
spending a few days at Penmachno, in North Wales, where I had delivered
a lecture, I dreamt that I was receiving a letter; and when I looked at
the envelope, I recognised the handwriting at once as that of Lady
Hills-Johnes, of Dolaucothy. I then opened the letter and read it all
through, and found it was from her Ladyship; and when I awoke up from
my sleep I remembered every word of its contents. In the morning as
soon as I went down for breakfast, the landlady of the house delivered
me a letter which had come by post. I looked at the envelope as I had
done in my dream; it was from Lady Hills-Johnes; and when I read it, I
discovered that I knew every word of its contents beforehand from my
dream.</p>
<p class="par">When I was in Australia ten years ago, I had another
remarkable dream about Dolaucothy, just when Sir James Hills-Johnes was
leaving home for South Africa, to see his friend Lord Roberts, during
the War; but I have been asked by Lady Hill-Johnes not to publish the
dream.</p>
<p class="par">A remarkable fulfilment of a dream was reported in the
&ldquo;Aberystwyth Observer&rdquo; in the year 1888, in relation to the
sudden death of the late Colonel Pryse, an uncle of Viscountess Parker,
and Great-uncle of Sir Edward Webley-Parry-Pryse, Bart., of the ancient
Family of Gogerddan:&mdash;&ldquo;It was not considered safe to break
to Viscountess Parker the news of her uncle&rsquo;s death for some
days, and Mr. Fryer went up to London to convey to her the information.
On his arrival at her residence, in Montague Square, a maid announced
to her Ladyship his arrival. &lsquo;Mr. Fryer!&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;I know what it is. My uncle is dead. He died on a <span class=
"corr" id="xd24e7102" title="Source: lone">lane</span> leading from
Rhiwarthen to Penwern. I have dreamt four times in four years that this
would happen, and the last time was the night before baby was born. I
have tried many times to keep him from going that way. Ask Mr. Fryer to
come up.<span class="corr" id="xd24e7105" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> She afterwards said that she meant the
road leading to Penuwch which is in the same direction, and that she
would know the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The editor of &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; gives authenticity
to the following dream:&mdash;A young man, engaged in a china
manufactory at Swansea, about the beginning of the last century,
dreamed that he saw a man drowning in one of their pools; he dreamed
the same a second time, and a third time, and then could not resist
making an effort to rise and satisfy himself that it was not so. He did
rise, went to the spot, and found the man drowned. A man in the
neighbourhood of Newcastle Emlyn, dreamed a similar dream in the 18th
century. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The late Rev. J. E. Jenkins, Rector of Vaynor, in
Breconshire, in his interesting book on that parish gives the following
account of a girl saved by a dream:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The Rev. Williams Jones, afterwards Canon Jones,
was curate in sole charge here in 1822, and for many years afterwards.
The Old Rectory House and the Glebe land was at that time occupied by a
man named Enos Davies and his family. The Rev. W. Jones also had rooms
at the Rectory.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e7117" title=

year, about two o&rsquo;clock Enos had a remarkable dream. He dreamt
the Church was on fire. He suddenly awoke, and in great excitement
jumped out of bed and knocked at the bedroom door of Mr. Jones, and
cried:&mdash;&lsquo;Master! Master! come down at once, I have dreamt
the Church is on fire<span class="corr" id="xd24e7120" title=
"Not in source">.</span>&rsquo; The worthy divine laughed at him, and
told him to go back to bed, and not to give heed to foolish dreams and
nightly visions. Enos obeyed, but could not sleep. During the day Mr.
Jones walked down to the Church, and found everything in the usual
order, safe and uninjured. The following morning, at the same hour,
strange to say, Enos had the same dream, and again disturbed the
peaceful slumbers of his good master. &lsquo;Come down to Church,
Master,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;there must be something wrong, I have
again dreamt the Church is on fire.&rsquo; &lsquo;All right
Enos,&rsquo; said Mr. Jones; &lsquo;I will come with you, it is a fine
morning.&rsquo; By the time they reached the Church it was half-past
three. Coming-down the Lych Gate, which was close by the little
brook&mdash;the old entrance&mdash;they were struck with a great awe
and a terrified feeling came over them, for they heard a peculiar sound
coming, as it were, from the direction of the Church. They stood,
listened, and looked at each other in mute astonishment, and
Enos&rsquo;s hair stood on end. The sound became plainer: it was like
the sound of a sexton digging or opening a grave inside the Church, as
was often the custom in those days. Enos trembled, and became as pale
as death; whilst the clergyman, who was a tall strongly built man,
entered the churchyard, and stealthily went to listen at the west door.
He could distinctly hear a man digging a grave. Mr. Jones soon found
that an entrance had been made into the Church through one of the north
side windows. Re-tracing his steps to Enos, who was still standing on
the road by the brook, his attention was directed to a young girl
coming down the steep pathway over Cae Burdudd&mdash;&lsquo;the field
of carnage&rsquo;&mdash;the field where the mound is. She came running
down merrily, and in a pleasant manner, said&mdash;&lsquo;good morning,
Mr. Jones, you are here before me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, my girl,&rsquo;
said the curate, &lsquo;where are you going so early?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>&lsquo;Coming to be married, to be sure;&rsquo;
was her joyous reply. The curate took in the situation in a moment and
told her:&mdash;&lsquo;You have made a mistake as to the time. You must
wait till eight o&rsquo;clock; I cannot marry you before eight. Go up
to the Rectory to Mrs. Davies and get some breakfast; we shall come
after you in a short time. We will wait here until John comes, and will
bring him up.&rsquo; The innocent girl departed as requested, but had
not gone far when the south door of the church was opened from within
by her treacherous lover. He was at once apprehended by the courageous
curate and Enos, and was made to stand over the grave he had prepared
for the girl he had shamefully deceived and ruined, and whom he had
intended murdering. He pleaded hard for mercy, and, ultimately, in
order to avoid public scandal, on his promising to leave the
neighbourhood immediately, and never again to return to Vaynor, he was
allowed to depart. He was a native of Herefordshire, and was at this
time in a service at a well-known farm in the parish. He left at once,
and was never heard of afterwards by anyone from this parish. The
curate, in a calm, gentle way, partly detailed to the maid the evil
intentions of her base lover, and stated how God, in his good
providence by the means of a dream, had preserved her from an untimely
death.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e7126" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The young girl was terribly shocked, and
fell unconscious into the arms of the curate. She lost her health, and
after a time was taken home to the neighbourhood of Knighton, and in a
few months later news reached Vaynor that the poor girl had died of a
broken heart, and the curate was asked to go up to bury her, but failed
to go. The above account was given me by my predecessor, the Rev. Rees
Williams, and was confirmed by the testimony of the late Mrs. Thomas,
formerly of Cwm and others. Mrs. Evans, late of Pengellifach, however,
added that the would-be murderer was handed over by Mr. Jones to the
charge of the Parish Constable, and was afterwards released. It should
be remembered that there were but few, if any, fixed pews in the Old
Church, only movable benches. Neither was the floor paved or
boarded.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par xd24e4279"><span class="xd24e4279init">T</span>here were
and there are still, many charms in use for the purpose of removing
warts; and the writer can prove from experience that there are cases of
complete cures through the instrumentality of charms.</p>
<p class="par">I remember once when I was a boy I had the misfortune of
having two big warts right under my foot, which caused me a great deal
of discomfort in walking. As I was complaining about this to my mother,
she advised me to go and see a lady friend of hers, who was the wife of
a very prominent gentleman in the neighbourhood. I went to the woman
and told her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>everything about the warts. She told me to go
home and take a small bit of flesh meat and rub the warts with it. Then
I was to go out though the back door, the meat in one hand, and a spade
in the other, and after proceeding to the middle of a field, dig a hole
in the ground, and bury the meat in it. Perfect silence was to be
observed during the ceremony, and everything to be done in secret, for
if detected in the act of burying the meat, the charm lost its
efficacy. I did everything as I was directed by the woman, and strange
to say within two or three days the warts had disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">Major Price Lewes, Tyglyn-Aeron, informed me that when
he was a boy at Llanllear, an old woman in the neighbourhood charmed
away warts from his hands.</p>
<p class="par">A woman in the neighbourhood of Ystrad Meurig informed
me that she got rid of her warts by washing her hands in the water in
which the blacksmith cools iron.</p>
<p class="par">Another way of charming away warts is to pick up small
white stones from a brook,&mdash;one stone for each wait&mdash;and rub
the warts with them. Then the stones are to be tied up in paper, and
the person who has the warts is to go to the nearest cross roads, and
throw the stones over his shoulders, and whoever picks up the parcel
gets the warts<span class="corr" id="xd24e7174" title=
"Not in source">.</span> A young woman in the parish of Llanarth, in
Cardiganshire, did this, and got rid of her warts. Soon after this an
old woman who lives in the neighbourhood, passed by, and picked up the
parcel of stones, thinking it contained some biscuits or sweets which
one of the school children had lost on the way home from school. But to
her great surprise, when she opened the paper, she only found small
white stones! After this the old woman found her hands covered with
warts; but she in her turn charmed them away by washing them with
spittle from the mouth. My informant was the old woman herself.</p>
<p class="par">Another charm for warts is to cut a slip of an elder
tree, and make a notch in it for every wart. Rub the elder against each
wart, and burn or bury it, and the warts will disappear.</p>
<p class="par">In former times Holy Wells were much resorted to by
those who desired to get rid of their warts, when a pin was dropped
into the well, and a rag with which the warts had been rubbed, hanged
on the nearest tree.</p>

Rosemary.</p>

a cloth around the right arm, will make the sick well.</p>
<p class="par">The smoke of Rosemary bark, sniffed, will, even if you

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One of the most famous and popular charms in the
central parts of Wales&mdash;especially Cardigan and
Carmarthenshire&mdash;was the magic and mysterious word Abracadabra,
which was obtained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284"
name="pb284">284</a>]</span>from wizards by paying a certain sum of
money for it. The word was inscribed on a paper or parchment, line
under line, repeating the same, but with one letter less in each line
till it ended in A, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par xd24e190">A B R A C A D A B R A<br>

<p class="par">There are many people even at the present day in West
and Mid-Wales who keep this mystic cabala in their houses as a most
valuable treasure. It is called &ldquo;papur y Dewin&rdquo; (the
wizard&rsquo;s paper). It was considered a protection against witches
and the &ldquo;evil eye,&rdquo; as well as all other evil influences;
and an antidote against fevers. It was effective to protect both
persons and animals, houses, etc. Sometimes it was worn round the neck,
or on the breast, at other times carried in the pocket, and kept in the
house. It was also the custom to rub the charm over cattle or to tie it
round their horns, especially when witchcraft was suspected.</p>
<p class="par">This mysterious word, Abracadabra, to which the
superstitious attributed such magical power was, according to some,
invented by one Basilides, and that he intended the name of God by it.
Others say that it was the name of an ancient heathen deity worshipped
in Syria, or in Assyria. Dr. Ralph Bathurst is of the opinion that the
word is a corrupt Hebrew: dabar is <span lang="la">verbu</span>, and
abraca is <span lang="la">benedixit</span>; that is <span lang=
"la">verbum benedixit</span>.</p>
<p class="par">As the charm appears very much like a pyramid (though
upside down), perhaps that has something to do with the superstition
concerning its magical power: anything in the shape of a pyramid is
considered very lucky, quite as much as&mdash;if not more so&mdash;than
a horse-shoe.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE PENTACLE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Cadrawd, in the &ldquo;Welsh Tit-Bits&rdquo;
column of the &ldquo;Cardiff Times,&rdquo; speaking of South
Pembrokeshire, says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">The pentacle, or pentalpha&mdash;a figure consisting of
five straight lines so joined and intersected as to form a five-pointed
star&mdash;is still regarded in Fleming-land as a physical charm and
the repository <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>of Talismanic power. This credulity is identical
with the traditions of the Greek Christians, who used the figure as a
mystic sign in astrology and necromancy. The figure was held in
veneration by medi&aelig;valists, and was known as the &ldquo;Pentacle
of Solomon.&rdquo; Sir William Jones, the great Oriental scholar, in
his work on &ldquo;Folklore,&rdquo; observes that &ldquo;it is worthy
of remark that at the present time the magical pentalpha in the western
window of the southern aisle of Westminster Abbey is one of the emblems
which still exist and speaks to the initiate that the black monks who
once chanted in the choir were deeply read in occult
science.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some years ago, when on a tour in quest of lore, a
Pembrokeshire gentleman tells us that he remembers being puzzled by the
appearance of a number of pentacles being cut into the bark of several
oak trees near the solitary dwelling of a charmer. He addressed the
Solon a few questions on the meaning of these strange figures, but was
cut short with the reply, &ldquo;They be signs.&rdquo; On Cresswell
Hill, near Lady&rsquo;s Well, there grows a row of tall beeches, on one
of which may be seen the figure of a pentacle. It stands about 15 feet
from the ground, and the wound was evidently made well nigh a century
ago, judging by its appearance. There is a tale that many years ago the
&ldquo;White Ladies&rdquo; were charmed away or banished from the
vicinity of the Lady&rsquo;s Well, of Cottage Dingle, by means of
several pentacles being cut into the bark of trees growing near by.</p>

<h3 class="main">CHARMS FOR CATTLE AND PIGS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">An old man named Evan Morris, Goginan, near
Aberystwyth, informed me that he had several times consulted a conjurer
in cases of bewitched cows and pigs. The conjurer, said my informant,
took a sheet of paper on which he drew a circular figure very much
&ldquo;like the face of a clock.&rdquo; Sometimes he made more than one
figure, which he filled in with writing. In fact, the paper was covered
all over with writings and figures and symbols; and it took the wise
man about half-an-hour to do this. This paper or charm, the conjurer
gave to my informant, and charged him to rub the bewitched
animal&rsquo;s back with it, &ldquo;all over the back right from the
ears to the tail,&rdquo; and at the same time repeating the words,
&ldquo;In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo; Morris added that this charm never failed. His
sister-in-law once had a sow which refused to take any food for nine
days; a farrier was sent for, but when he came, he could do nothing. At
last, my informant went to a conjurer and obtained a charm, with which
his sister-in-law, after some hesitation, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>rubbed the sow,
repeating &ldquo;In the name, etc.&rdquo; and to their great surprise
the sow fully recovered and began to eat immediately, and soon ate up
all the food intended for two fat pigs. When I asked my informant to
show me one of the papers he obtained from the conjurer, he stated that
he never kept such paper longer than twelve months. I next asked him if
he had read one of the papers, and what were the words written on it?
He replied that he could not decipher the conjurer&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Hamer, in &ldquo;The Montgomeryshire
Collections,&rdquo; vol X., page 249, states that a paper or charm in
his possession opens thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. Amen ... and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my
redeemer, that I will give relief to &mdash;&mdash; creatures his cows,
and his calves, and his horses, and his sheep, and his pigs, and all
creatures that alive be in his possession, from all witchcraft and from
all other assaults of Satan. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Hamer also states that &ldquo;at the bottom of the
sheet, on the left, is the magical word, &ldquo;Abracadabra,&rdquo;
written in the usual triangular form; in the centre, a number of
planetary symbols, and on the right, a circular figure filled in with
lines and symbols, and underneath them the words, &lsquo;By Jah, Joh,
Jah?&rsquo; It was customary to rub these charms over the cattle, etc.,
a number of times, while some incantation was being mumbled. The paper
was then carefully folded up, and put in some safe place where the
animals were housed, as a guard against future visitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In West Wales, there was once a kind of charm performed
upon a cow after calving, when some fern was set on fire to produce
smoke, over which a sheaf was held until it was well-smoked. Then it
was given to the cow, to be consumed by the animal.</p>

Gilfachwen, Llandyssul, by D. J. Lloyd, Esq., a small white stone, not

little substance of the stone was scraped off, and mixed with milk and
given as a dose to the patients. In years gone by&mdash;though not

curative power it has or was supposed to have. I only know that it was
very much in request many years ago. It came to my father&rsquo;s
possession on the death of his uncle, Rev. David Bowen, of Waunifor
about the year 1847. In those days and for many years afterwards, mad
dogs were very &ldquo;fashionable,&rdquo; a summer never passing
without one hearing of a great many people having been bitten, and,
consequently, a great many people called at Gilfachwen for a dose of
the Llaethfaen, and whether it had curative or preventive powers or
not, none of the patients were ever known to be attacked with
hydrophobia. People who had been bitten would travel immense distances
in order to get the stone. I remember a whole family, father, mother,
and four or five children, who had been bitten by the same dog,
arriving at Gilfachwen early one summer morning, before anyone was up,
having travelled all night in order to be treated with the stone cure;
they went away very happy and relieved in mind, after each had received
a dose. It has not been used now for many years. The last instance I
recollect was this: two men employed in a Brewery at Llanon, on the
Cardigan coast, had been bitten by the same dog, supposed to be mad,
arrived here on a Sunday afternoon; poor fellows, they looked utterly
miserable and wretched; they had spent nearly a week enquiring for the
stone, and meanwhile, had been advised by some old woman who was
supposed to be learned in some ailments, not to eat any food; this
advice they very foolishly followed, and when they arrived here, they
were truly in a terrible plight. After giving each of them a dose of
the Llaethfaen and a good meal they went away happy and never heard of
them since.</p>

<p class="par">It is rather interesting that Iolo Morganwg saw a stone
of this kind in the year 1802, in the neighbourhood of Bridell, North
Pembrokeshire. The following extracts from Iolo&rsquo;s Diary appeared
in &ldquo;Young Wales,&rdquo; June, 1901:&mdash;&ldquo;Leave Cardigan,
take the road to Llanfernach. Bridell Church.... Meet a man who carries
a stone about the country, which he calls Llysfaen. Scrapes it into
powder with a knife, and sells it at about five shillings an ounce as
an infallible remedy for the canine madness. He says that this stone is
only to be found on the mountains after a thunderstorm, that every eye
cannot see it. He showed me the stone, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>when
I assured him and a little crowd that had gathered about him, that the
stone was only a piece of the Glamorgan alabaster, the poor fellow was
confounded and seemed very angry; but I was surprised to hear many
positively assert that they had actually seen the Hydrophobia cured in
dogs and man with this powder given in milk, and used as the only
liquid to be taken nine days, and the only food also.... The name by
which this fellow named his stone is obviously a corruption of
Cleisfaen, from its blushy white colour, veined or spotted with a livid
or blackish blue colour like that of a bruise (<span lang=

following story is given:&mdash;A man attacked with hydrophobia

<p class="par first">A writer in &ldquo;Cymru Fu&rdquo; an interesting
reprint from &ldquo;The Weekly Mail,&rdquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">It is a well-known fact that &ldquo;clefyd y
Galon,&rdquo; or love-sickness is a very prevalent complaint in Wales,
especially among young <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href=

<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Minau&rsquo;n ceisio caru Gwen, a hithau&rsquo;n

</div>
<p class="par first">A cure of this disease has been for centuries, and
still is, a secret of great value in the Principality, and there are
many old women, and some young men, now living, who are making splendid
profits out of the secret they have in their possession. An old wag
called &ldquo;Ned y Wain,&rdquo; who resided near Aberystwyth; Harries,
Cwrtycadno; and a shrewd old woman in the neighbourhood of Ystumtuen,
Cardiganshire, practised the &ldquo;cure&rdquo; as a part of a
professional conjuring, and many excellent but ridiculous stories are
current anent the visits of young females, especially the &ldquo;Ladies
of Borth,&rdquo; to the chambers of the enchanters. The
&ldquo;secret&rdquo; came into my possession thirty-eight years ago in
the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">When a young lad at home, I had the privilege of
visiting a farm house, the last on the borders of Cardiganshire,
adjoining Montgomeryshire, where resided a wealthy young widower now
living. The landlady of the adjoining farm on the other side of the
River Llyfnwy, during my stay, used to cross the river frequently to
visit the young widower, with whom she spent hours closeted in the
parlour. The frequency of her calls, and the great secrecy observed at
her coming and going, drew my attention, and provoked my curiosity, and
I began to twit the young widower, who was a local preacher, of
something he could not very well relish, and in order to clear himself
of all suspicion, he told me that the woman visited him only to cure
Clefyd-y-galon; and handed over to me the cherished secret, which I now
divulge as a relic of the dark days of Wales, and for the amusement of
the readers of &ldquo;Cymru Fu.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The MS. was in Welsh, of which the appended is a
translation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1st.&mdash;Ask the name of the person, and the surname,
and the age; and take a double threaded yarn and measure it with your
naked arm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger three times,
naming the person, and saying the age, in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost. Then put a mark on the thread, and if it is on
the person the thread will shorten, but it not, the thread will
lengthen. For example, say thus&mdash;I am Joseph, thirty-six years of
age in the name of the Father, the Son <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>and the Holy Ghost;
and measuring, and say it each time while measuring; and do not cut the
thread until you have measured three times. It is necessary that the
thread should be scoured white wool. Take care not to put the age of
the person more than it is. Then put it round the neck of the person,
and leave it there for three nights; then take it from the neck and
bury it under the ashes in the name of the Trinity. Put a knot on one
end of it after cutting it. It is necessary to look several times if
the person is recovering or not. Should the thread shorten above the
middle finger, there is but little hopes of his recovery; nevertheless,
many recover when it shortens the finger&rsquo;s length. It is
necessary to keep the whole affair as secret as you possibly can.
Again, take notice, it is necessary to measure three lengths from the
elbow to the tip of the middle finger; then put a mark on the spot, or
let anyone take hold of it; then begin to measure the same way again,
naming as said before until you have measured three times, and take
notice, as said before if the thread shortens.</p>

<p class="par first">There is preserved at the mansion of Nanteos, near
Aberystwyth, a sacred healing cup known in Welsh as the
&ldquo;Phiol,&rdquo; which interesting relic was shown me a few years
ago by Mrs. W. B. Powell, to whom, and to the genial Squire, I am
indebted for much kindness and respect. In the same week an intelligent

"pb294">294</a>]</span>London, as she had such faith in the efficacy
and healing virtues of the Sacred Cup.</p>
<p class="par">The Cup is of a very dark wood and supposed to have been
formed from the wood of the true Cross, and it seems to have been
preserved in the Abbey of Strata Florida. At the time of the
Dissolution, the Abbey, lands and goods, were given to the Stedman
family, who also carefully preserved the relic, and from that family it
passed over to the Powells as well as the demesne.</p>

were ill, especially those suffering from hemorrhage to send to Nanteos
for the loan of this healing cup, as it was supposed to possess healing
power which could only be called miraculous, and there are many
instances of cures believed to have been effected by taking food and
medicine or wine out of the cup. It is a great pity that this
interesting relic is now in an unshapely condition, having been
considerably damaged by some of the patients who were not content with
drinking from it, but tried to bite away parts of the cup itself.</p>
<p class="par">It is quite possible that this holy relic was the
chalice therein our Lord consecrated the wine and water at the
institution of the Eucharist, and in which was said to be preserved
some of the blood which fell from the Saviour&rsquo;s wounds as he hung
on the cross.</p>

in &ldquo;Cardiganshire and its Antiquities,&rdquo; 1903, by permission
of George Eyre Evans.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In an interesting little book written five years ago, by
Miss Ethelwyn M. Amery, B.A., entitled &ldquo;Sought and Found,&rdquo;
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>writer, after giving the story of the the Holy
Grail, concludes. &ldquo;Not far from the sea-side town of Aberystwyth,
in Mid-Wales, stands the House of Nanteos, the country seat of the
Powells. The family is an ancient one; it was ancient in the days of
the Reformation, and is possessed of all the traditions of antiquity,
including a phantom coach, which foretells death. To this house came,
one summer&rsquo;s day, a party of holiday-makers from
Aberystwyth&mdash;ordinary twentieth century people, with all the most
up-to-date ideas&mdash;and to them was shown the house and its
treasures. There was old armour in the hall, old china in the gallery,
a wonderful carved arch in the drawing-room, and many other things
which attract the sightseer, attracted one and another of the party.
But there were a few who had no eyes for these things; to them the
centre of interest was found in a small glass, carefully covered with
silk, which was brought out to the lawn from its home in the library,
so that all might more easily see it. Now those who looked at this case
wondered what this treasure could be which was thus carefully guarded,
and when the cover was withdrawn, the astonishment of many more than
equalled their previous curiosity, for in this case was a fragment of
wood, at first sight shapeless and worm-eaten (and many saw no more
than this), but those who looked more closely saw that this worm-eaten
fragment was shaped like a wooden bowl about five inches high, of which
one side was broken nearly down to the foot, and the other part was
roughly held together by two rivets. Many having seen this were
satisfied, and went away, but some listened to what their hostess told
them concerning the cup, and this is the story she told:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Many years ago, when Henry VIII. was
destroying the Monasteries, his servants came into Wales, and hearing
of an ancient Monastery among the hills, where only seven old monks
remained to guard their treasure, he determined to destroy the Abbey
and seize their goods. But the monks were warned by friendly
neighbours, and fled by night, bearing their treasure with them. Their
journey was long and dangerous for such old men, but they reached the
House of Nanteos in safety, and deposited the treasure they had
suffered so much to save. One by one the old monks died, and at the
point of death he entrusted the treasure to the owner of the house that
had sheltered them, until the Church should once more claim its own.
But the Church has not yet claimed it, and it is that treasure of the
monks which you now see.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And again some were satisfied and went away, only
wondering that the old monks risked their lives for so small a thing.
But those who remained heard further, that the monks had regarded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>this cup as sacred. Many reasons were given for
this: one was that it had a Communion Chalice, another that it
possessed miraculous power of healing, but the true reason is told only
to the few who press closely for it, and it is thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e7488" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Not for its healing properties alone was
this cup treasured, not because from it the Monks had received the
Communion wine; the cup was older than the Monastery&mdash;indeed, the
Monastery had been built to receive it; it had been handed down from
Abbott to Abbott through the ages, and in each age its secret was told
to one or two, that they might guard it the more carefully, for this
cup is none other than the one from which our Lord drank at the Last
Supper&mdash;the cup so eagerly sought for by King Arthur&rsquo;s
knights; found and handled by many, who, because of their blindness
were unable to perceive the treasure which was before them; seen and
realized by the pure knight Galahad, and then hidden from common touch
and sight during the sinful days which followed, but preserved
carefully through them all, and powerful even yet to give to those who
will wait for it, a faint&mdash;alas! very faint&mdash;glimpse of
Galahad&rsquo;s vision, and to remind them that even yet &lsquo;The
pure in heart shall see God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Just as I am sending this to the press, Mrs. Powell of
Nanteos, showed me a letter which she had just received from a noble
French lady begging her to send to her in a letter, an handkerchief, or
ever a rag, which had been tied round this Healing Cup for 24
hours.</p>

<h3 class="main">HOLY WELLS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par xd24e4279"><span class="xd24e4279init">T</span>here is
much Folk-Lore in connection with wells, in Wales, and an interesting
volume might be written on the subject. Holy Wells were once much
frequented by devotees in search of health, omens, or prognostications
of coming events; and even at the present day some of them are made use
of as wishing wells by young men and young women, who throw a bent or a
crooked pin into the well, and wishing at the same time. In the old
times when &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Gwyliau Mabsant</span>,&rdquo; or
Saints&rsquo; Fetes, were in vogue in Wales, wells were sometimes the
scenes of great merriment, both before and even after the Reformation.
According to an old writer they were much frequented in the time of
Queen Elizabeth. The habit of tying rags to the branches of a tree
close to the well was well-known once in several places. This was done
by people who were suffering from maladies. The rag was first dipped in
the water, and the afflicted part of the body bathed with it.
Afterwards before going away from the well the rag was tied to the
branch of a tree near it. It is also worth mentioning that this
ceremony is in vogue in Eastern Countries as well, such as Arabia and
Persia. As far as Wales is concerned, some of the wells frequented in
times past, possessed medicinal properties; but it must be admitted
that some of the superstitious ceremonies which were performed at them,
must have come down from pre-Christian times; and it seems evident that
water was once an object of worship, or at least of veneration, and
that offerings were made either to the water itself, or more probably
to the tutelary god of the fountain. This was the opinion of the late
Rev. Elias Owen, F.S.A., who had made a special study of the subject
all his life-time. That the inhabitants of Great Britain were, in
ancient times, given to the adoration of fountains, is evident from the
fact that in 960, King Edgar commanded by Canon law &ldquo;That every
priest industriously advance Christianity and extinguish heathenism and
forbid the &lsquo;Worship of Fountains, and necromancy and
auguries.<span class="corr" id="xd24e7522" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>&rdquo; But finding the worship of
fountains too strong to put down at once, the priest effected a
compromise, by transferring veneration from the tutelary god by
dedicating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>the well to a saint, and building a church on
the spot, and baptised his flock in the well; nevertheless many pagan
customs of well worship lingered on from generation to generation. At
the present day in some places, we find a village pump situated at the
corner of the Churchyard, which is not at all a good thing from a
sanitary point of view. But we must bear in mind that the well was
there before the Churchyard, and that in most of such cases the site of
the Church had been fixed upon because of the virtue and attractions of
the well.</p>
<div class="div3 section" id="xd24e7527">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">ST. TEILO&rsquo;S WELL.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This strong spring rises within a short distance
of the ruined church of Llandilo Llwydiarth, near Maenclochog, in
Pembrokeshire, and close by, there is a farm-house in which a skull,
traditionally called &ldquo;Penglog Teilo,&rdquo; (Teilo&rsquo;s Skull)
is kept, and has been kept from time immemorial. This skull is used for
drinking water out of from St. Teilo&rsquo;s Well. In former times St.
Teilo&rsquo;s Well had a wide-spread reputation as a healing well, and
the sick from all parts of South Wales resorted to it; but it was
considered absolutely necessary to drink the water out of the skull,
which had to be dipped in the well, and filled with water, and handed
to the patient by the hereditary keeper. The present keeper of the
relic is Mr. Melchior, an intelligent farmer, who informed me that his
ancestors had been keepers of the skull from time immemorial. How the
skull first came there, Mr. Gibby, of Llangolman, gave the following
tradition:&mdash;When St. Teilo was dying he bade a female servant take
his skull from Llandilo, in Carmarthenshire, to Llandilo, in
Pembrokeshire, and that if this was done, the skull would be a blessing
to coming generations of men who would have their health restored by
drinking water out of it. According to another tradition which I have
heard, the skull came from Llandaff Cathedral, where St. Teilo was
Bishop, though born in the neighbourhood of Tenby. If we believe the
old legend, the miracles he worked in death were marvellous; for,
&ldquo;on the night of his decease, there arose a great dispute between
the clergy of the three Churches each asserting its authority and
privileges for obtaining his body; but at length, attending to the
advice of discreet men, they had recourse to fasting and prayer, that
Christ, the great judge, who is the true authority, and privilege of
holy persons, should declare by some sign, to which of them he would be
pleased to commit the body of the saint. And in the morning a certain
elder, looking towards the place where the body was, spoke with a loud
voice, saying, &ldquo;Our prayer, brethren, has been heard by the Lord,
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>deprives no one of his reward; arise, and behold
what things have been done by Christ the meditator between God and man,
that our dispute might be settled; and as in the life so in the death
of the holy confessor, Teilo, miracles should be performed.&rdquo; For,
lo! they saw there three bodies, to which there was the same dimensions
of body, the same beauty of countenance; they had the lineaments of the
whole frame, without any difference. So peace being restored, each with
their own corpse returned homewards, and they buried the different
bodies in those several places with the greatest reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">St. Teilo died in the year 566, and people of the
present day hardly believe that the relic at Llandilo Llwydiarth is the
real skull of this saint, though the skull in question is a very old
one, and only the brain pan now remains. About five years ago an old
man named John Griffiths, living in the village of Maenclochog,
informed me that he well remembered the time when people came to St.
Teilo&rsquo;s Well, from all parts of the country, for the alleviation
of their ailments, &ldquo;and were cured&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by
faith.&rdquo; The same old man also told me that when a boy, he and
other two boys who were suffering from the whooping cough, were sent by
their mothers early in the morning to drink water from the well out of
the skull. They did so and got rid of their coughs entirely. I was told
by another person in the neighbourhood, that about seventy years ago, a
gentleman from Glamorganshire, drove his consumptive son in a carriage
all the way to Pembrokeshire, to try this healing fountain of St.
Teilo, but arrived home in Swansea without feeling any better. He had
drunk the water from the well, but not out of the skull. His father
took the boy all the way to St. Teilo&rsquo;s Well a second time, and
now made him drink out of the skull, and was completely cured of his
complaint. When I was spending a few weeks at Maenclochog, some years
ago, in quest of information, I accompanied Mr. Melchior to the well
one day, and drank out of the skull. But, unfortunately, I did not get
rid of my cold, from which I was suffering at the time, but, perhaps,
my faith was not strong enough.</p>

tradition concerning them, to old records in the possession of the Rev.
Canon Lloyd, B.D., Vicar of that parish. Llanpumpsaint, of course,
means the &ldquo;Church of the Five Saints.&rdquo; According to the
tradition the five wells were made use of by the five Saints, and each
particular saint had his particular well. In former times on St.
Peter&rsquo;s Day, yearly, between two and three hundred people got
together, some to wash in, and some to see the wells. In the summer
time the people in the neighbourhood bathed themselves in the wells to
cure their aches.</p>

virtues. It is surrounded by a small building and within a few years of
the present time, people in search of health took the trouble of coming
from long distances to drink from and to bathe in its waters. When the
Rev. Z. M. Davies, vicar of the parish, and myself, visited the spot
five years ago, a lady living quite close to the well, informed us,
that a short time previously, a crippled girl from Glamorganshire, who
had come there on crutches, was able to walk away without them, and
left them behind.</p>
<p class="par">Ffynnon Francis, is also a well in the Parish of
Llanfihangel Geneu&rsquo;r Glyn, on a farm called Penuchaf, and it

The holy well there, known as Canna&rsquo;s Well, was much resorted to
in former times, as its water was supposed to cure ague and intestinal

or bathe in it, it was customary for the patient to sit down in
&ldquo;Canna&rsquo;s Chair&rdquo; for a certain length of time and try
to sleep. &ldquo;Canna&rsquo;s Chair&rdquo; is a stone. In former times

<p class="par first">About <span class="corr" id="xd24e7586" title=
"Source: iour">four</span> miles to the east of the town of Llandilo,
in Carmarthenshire, are the remains of a remarkable old castle called
Careg Cenen, which stands on the summit of a solitary rock. This rock
is about 300 feet high. The most noted feature in connection with the
Castle is its underground gallery. In one part of the building a
passage terminates in a flight of steps leading down to a dark
subterranean cave of about 200, or perhaps, 250 feet long, and at the
end of this passage or cave, there is a well which is still used as a
&ldquo;wishing well,&rdquo; more especially by young people. When I
went to see the remains of the Castle a few years ago, I also visited
the subterranean cave. After lighting a candle and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>descending the flight of steps, I proceeded
along this dark and marvellous passage slowly and cautiously, as there
was water in some places. After going on underground in this manner
about forty yards, to my great surprise, I heard the sound of human
voices, and saw a light in front of me; and all of a sudden I came upon
three young ladies, one from London, and two from Ammanford, who
informed me that they had intended going on as far as the well, but
turned back before reaching it, as they were afraid of proceeding any
further into the interior of such a dreary dungeon. However, when I
offered to take the lead, they followed me with joy, and at last we
reached the Wishing Well at the far end of the cave. Before we left the
spot, each one of the three young ladies threw a bent pin into the
well, wishing, I suppose that she might have her heart&rsquo;s desire.
We found many pins at the bottom of the well, which had been probably
left there by young people given to the practice of amorous spells.</p>

it. But once upon a time a certain farmer in the neighbourhood
<span class="corr" id="xd24e7746" title="Source: seut">sent</span> a
boy almost every day to the well to water his horse. Whenever the boy
returned the farmer always asked him, &ldquo;Did you put back the stone
over the mouth of the well, my boy?&rdquo; The boy answered
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; One day, however, when in a hurry, the lad quite
forgot about replacing the stone, and the consequence was that the
water of the well burst forth till it formed a lake. The above story
was told me by an old man named John Jones, who lives in the small town
of Llangadock, who added that he had heard it from his mother when a

Cambrensis seven hundred years ago, says:&mdash;&ldquo;In the reign of
King Henry I., Gruffydh, son of Rhys ap Theodor, held under the King,
one comot, namely, the fourth part of the cantred of Caoc, in the
Cantref Mawr, which, in title and dignity, was esteemed by the Welsh,
equal to the southern part of Wales, called Deheubarth, that is, the
right-hand side of Wales. When Gruffydh, on his return from the
King&rsquo;s Court, passed near this lake, which at that cold season of
the year was covered with waterfowl of various sorts, being accompanied
by Milo, Earl of Hereford, and Lord of Brecheinioc, and Payn Fitz-John,
Lord of Ewyas, who were at that time secretaries and privy counsellors
of the King; Earl Milo, wishing to draw forth from Gruffydh some
discourse concerning his innate nobility, rather jocularly than
seriously thus addressed him: &lsquo;It is an ancient saying in Wales,
that if the natural prince of the country, coming to this lake, shall
order the birds to sing, they will immediately obey him.&rsquo; To
which Gruffydh, richer in mind than in gold (for though his inheritance
was diminished, his ambition and dignity still remained), answered,
&lsquo;Do you therefore, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href=

land, first give the command&rsquo;; but he and Payn having in vain
commanded, and Gruffydh, perceiving that it was necessary for him to do
so in his turn, dismounted from his horse, and falling on his knees
towards the East, as if he had been about to engage in battle,
prostrate on the ground, with his eyes and hands uplifted to Heaven,
poured forth devout prayers to the Lord: at length, rising up, and
signing his face and forehead with the figure of the cross, he thus
openly spake: &lsquo;Almighty God, and Lord Jesus Christ, who knowest
all things, declare here this day Thy power. If Thou hast caused me to
descend lineally from the natural princes of Wales, I command these
birds in Thy name to declare it;<span class="corr" id="xd24e7775"

the water with their wings, began to cry aloud, and proclaim him. The
spectators were astonished and confounded; and Earl Milo hastily
returning with Payn Fitz-John to Court, related this singular
occurrence to the King, who is said to have replied, &lsquo;By the
death of Christ (an oath he was accustomed to use), it is not a matter
of so much wonder; for although by our great authority we commit acts
of violence and wrong against these people yet they are known to be the
rightful inheritors of this land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Severn, the Wye, and the Rheidol rise on
Plinlimon Mountain. These rivers, which are called three sisters,
agreed to make a visit to the sea in the morning. Severn rose up very
early, and took compass through Shropshire, Worcestershire, and
Gloucestershire. Wye rose later and took her journey through the
counties of Radnorshire and Hereford, falling in with her sister near
Chepstow, and went hand in hand to the ocean. Rheidol indulged in her
dreams and lay so late that she was forced to take the nearest road to
Aberystwyth. According to another version of this legend five sister
fountains are mentioned, namely, Wye, Severn, Rheidol, Llyfnant and the
Dulas.</p>
<p class="par">There is another interesting old legend having close
connection with the Severn, the following version of which is given by
Milton in his History of Britain:&mdash;&ldquo;After this Brutus in a
chosen place, built Troja Nova, changed in time to Trimovantum, now
London; and began to enact laws (Heli being then High Priest in Judea);
and having governed the whole isle twenty-four years died, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>was buried in his new Troy. Three
sons&mdash;Locrine, Albanact, and Camber&mdash;divided the land by
consent. Locrine had the middle part, Loegria; Camber possessed Cambria
or Wales; Albanact, Albania, now Scotland. But he in the end, by
Humber, King of the Hums, who, with a fleet, invaded that land, was
slain in fight, and his people driven back into Loegria. Locrine and
his brother go out against Humber; who now marching onward was by these
defeated, and in a river drowned, which to this day retains his name.
Among the spoils of his camp and navy were found certain maids, and
Estrilidis, above the rest, passing fair, the daughter of a King in
Germany, from whence Humber, as he went wasting the sea-coast, had led
her captive; whom Locrine, though before, contracted to the daughter of
Corineus, resolves to marry. But being forced and threatened by
Corineus, whose authority and power he feared, Gwendolen, the daughter,
he yields to marry, but in secret loves the other; and ofttimes
retiring as to some sacrifice, through vaults and passages made
underground, and seven years thus enjoying her, had by her a daughter
equally fair, whose name was Sabra. But when once his fear was off by
the death of Corineus, not content with secret enjoyment, divorcing
Gwendolen, he makes Estrilidis his queen. Gwendolen, all, in rage,
departs into Cornwall; where Pladan, the son she had by Locrine, was
hitherto brought up by Corineus, his grandfather; and gathering an army
of her father&rsquo;s friends, and subjects, gives battle to her
husband by the river Sture, wherein Locrine, shot with an arrow, ends
his life. But not so ends the fury of Gwendolen, for Estrilidis and her
daughter Sabra she throws into a river, and, to have a monument of
revenge proclaims that the stream be thenceforth called after the
damsel&rsquo;s name, which by length of time is changed now to Sabrina
or Severn.&rdquo; The Poet in his &ldquo;Mask of Comus&rdquo; makes the
nymph Sabrina &ldquo;that with moist curb sways the smooth Severn
stream&rdquo; the goddess of the river, but still retaining her maiden
gentleness, and the shepherds, at their festivals, &ldquo;Carol her
goodness loud in their rustic lays, and throw sweet garland wreaths
into her stream of pansies, pink, and gaudy daffodils. And, as the old
swain said, she can unlock the clasping charm, and thaw the number
spell, if she be right invoked in warbling song; for maidenhood she
loves, and will be swift to aid a virgin, such as was herself, in
hard-besetting need.&rdquo; In the year 1634 when this
&ldquo;Comus&rdquo; was presented at Ludlow Castle before the Lord
President of Wales, the President&rsquo;s own daughter, Lady Alice
Egerton, when only a little girl, acted in it; and it is an interesting
fact that this same Lady Alice, some years afterwards, <span class=

as a passport when stopped by the others. They lived for some years in
this cave, but at last they were executed for murder. One of them was

our ancient race of Brythons, did not, according to the Troed yr Aur
people, tarry in a foreign land, but somewhere in Wales, not far from
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke. They used to say that one Dafydd Meirig of Bettws
Bledrws, having quarrelled with his father left for England. When he
had got a considerable distance from home, he struck a bargain with a
cattle dealer to drive a herd of his beasts to London. Somewhere on the
corner of a vast moor, Dafydd cut a very remarkable hazel stick; for a
good staff is as essential to the vocation of a good drover as teeth
are to a dog<span class="corr" id="xd24e7878" title=

stranger accosted Dafydd, wishing to know where he had obtained that
wonderful stick. He replied that in Wales he had had it, and on the
stranger&rsquo;s assuring him that there were wonderful things beneath
the tree on which it had grown, they both set out for Wales. When they
reached the spot and dug a little they found that there was a great
hollow place beneath. As night was spreading out her sable mantle, and
as they were getting deeper, what should they find but stairs easy to
step, and great lamps illuminating the vast chamber! When they reached
the bottom of the stairs, they found themselves near a large table, at
one end of which they beheld sitting a tall man of about seven foot. He
occupied an old-fashioned chair and rested his head on his left hand,
while the other hand, all red, lay on the table and grasped a great
sword. He was withal enjoying a wondrously serene sleep, and at his
feet on the floor lay a big dog. After casting a glance at them, the
wizard said to Dafydd: &lsquo;This is Owen Lawgoch, who is to sleep on
till a special time, when he will wake and reign over the Brythons.
That weapon in his hand is one of the swords of the ancient Kings of
Britain.&rsquo; Then they moved slowly on, gazing at the wonders of
that subterranean chamber; and they beheld everywhere the arms of ages
long past, and on the table thousands of gold and silver pieces bearing
the images of the different Kings of Britain. They got to understand
that it was permitted them to take a handful of each, but not to put
any in their purses. They both visited the cave several times, but at
last Dafydd put in his purse a little of the gold bearing the image of
one of the Owen&rsquo;s ancestors. But after coming out again they were
never able any more to find Owen&rsquo;s subterranean
palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">This story of Owen Lawgoch and his sleeping warriors is
a version of the well-known Welsh tradition of the enchanted sleep of
King Arthur and his Knights.</p>
<p class="par">According to an old Welsh ballad, Owen Lawgoch does not
sleep in a cave in Wales, but &ldquo;tarries in a foreign land&rdquo;;
and Dr. O. T. Lewis, of the University College, addressing the
Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society, November 30th, 1910, stated that the
garrison at Aberystwyth &ldquo;was increased in 1369, when Owen Lawgoch
with his French auxiliaries were expected from beyond the seas.&rdquo;

<p class="par xd24e4279"><span class="xd24e4279init">T</span>his parish
is celebrated for its legendary lore; and no wonder for it is a spot of
great historic interest.</p>
<p class="par">There is a tradition current in the neighbourhood to the
effect that it was originally intended to build the Church of Llanddewi
Brefi in a field on Godregarth farm, and that the work was actually
commenced on that spot, but the attempt to build there was constantly
frustrated, for that which was set up during the day was pulled down in
the night by a Spirit, and all the material removed or carried to the
spot where the Parish Church now stands. The field pointed out by
tradition is about a mile away from the village, and yew trees are
still to be seen there.</p>
<p class="par">According to another most ancient tradition, when the
Church was in process of construction, two oxen known as the
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Ychain Bannog</span>&rdquo; were employed to
draw the stone required for the building. The load was so heavy that
one of the two oxen died in the attempt to drag it forward; but before
falling down dead he bellowed nine times, and so powerful was the echo
that the hill, which before presented itself as an obstacle, divided or
split in two. The other ox alone was then able to bring the load
unassisted to the site of the Church.</p>

<p class="line">Where the ox bellowed nine times,</p>
<p class="line">Till Foelallt rock split in two.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">According to another version of the story, it was
the ox which survived was the one that bellowed, and not the one that
died. According to another story given in Meyrick&rsquo;s History of
Cardiganshire, these two Bannog Oxen were on one occasion used to draw
&ldquo;away a monstrous beaver dead&rdquo;; but this is only a version
of a legend which is to be found in several parts of Wales, and is
founded on the older story of Hu Gadarn, or Hu the Mighty, who, with
his Bannog Oxen, drew to land the avanc out of Llyn Llion, so that the
lake burst out no more to deluge the earth. See <span class=

<p class="par">The two <span lang="cy">Ychain Bannog</span> of
Llanddewi were sometimes called &ldquo;<span lang="cy">dau ychain
Dewi</span>&rdquo; (St. David&rsquo;s two oxen). In a poem written in
the Twelfth Century, the Welsh Bard Gwynfardd Brycheiniog alludes to
the old tradition as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Dau ychan Dewi, deu odidawe,</p>
<p class="line">Dodyssant eu gwar dan garr kynawe,</p>
<p class="line">Dau ychen Dewi ardderchawe oeddynt.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">There used to be preserved at Llanddewi Church a
remarkable fragment of a horn called &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Madcorn yr
Ych Bannog</span>,&rdquo; that is, the core of the Bannog Ox&rsquo;s
Morn, which, according to tradition, had been kept there as a valuable
relic ever since the time of St. David. This horn is now at Llidiardau,
Llanilar, kept privately. It has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>been pronounced by Professor
Boyd Dawkins to have belonged to &ldquo;the great urns (Bos
Primigenius) that Charlemagne hunted in the forest of Aachen, and the
Monks of St. Galle ate on their feast days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When St. David was preaching at Llanddewi at the great
Synod, in the year 519, it is said that the ground on which he stood
rose up and formed a hillock under his feet. Cressy recounts the
miracle in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;When all the fathers
assembled enjoined David to preach, he commanded a child which attended
him, and had lately been restored to life by him, to spread a napkin
under his feet; and, standing upon it, he began to expound the Gospel
and the law to the auditory. All the while that this oration continued,
a snow-white dove, descending from Heaven, sate upon his shoulders;
and, moreover, the earth, on which he stood raised itself under him
till it became a hill, from whence his voice, like a trumpet, was
clearly heard and understood by all, both near and far off, on the top
of which hill a church was afterwards built, and remains to this
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The people of Llanddewi Brefi told me that there is
another tradition still extant in the neighbourhood, which says that as
St. David was preaching on this great occasion, a nightingale appeared
on the spot, and sang. The music of the bird was so sweet, that the
people listened to the nightingale&rsquo;s song, instead of continuing
to give their attention to the sermon. Seeing this, the Holy Saint
David rebuked the congregation, and informed them that the nightingale
should never again sing in the neighbourhood; and from that day till
now the bird has never been heard there. According to the great
historian George Owen, there is a different version of this story in
Pembrokeshire. &ldquo;St. David, being seriouse occupied in the night
tyme in his divine orizons, was so troubled with the sweete tuninges of
the nightingales, as that he could not fasten his minde upon heavenlie
cogitacions, as at other tymes, being letted (hindered) by the melodie
of the bird, praied unto the Almightie, that from that tyme forward
there might never a nightingale sing within his Dioces, and this saieth
our women (old wives&rsquo; fables), was the cause of confininge of the
bird out of this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At Llanio Isaf, in the parish of Llanddewi Brefi are the
remains of Loventium, which was a large Roman city. About half a mile
from Gogoyan, in the same parish, was once a holy well called Ffynon
Ddewi, or St. David&rsquo;s Well, the water of which, according to
tradition, flowed up miraculously when St. David restored to life the
son of a widow. The well has now been closed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>up,
and a house stands on the spot. There is another &ldquo;Ffynon
Ddewi,&rdquo; on the road-side between Aberaeron and Cardigan.</p>

<h3 class="main">CAIO (CARMARTHENSHIRE).</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the parish of Caio, there is a gold mine which
in ancient times was worked by the Romans. It is on the estate of
Dolaucothy, and the spot is known as the &ldquo;Ogofau,&rdquo; or
caves, and part of it is a height, hardly a mountain, that has been
scooped out like a volcanic crater by the Romans during their
occupation. In this hollow or basin it is said that the five saints
named Ceitho, Gwyn, Gwynno, Gwynnoro, and Celynin, who flourished in
the sixth century, had retired in a thunderstorm for shelter. They had
penetrated into the mine and had lost their way, and taking a stone for
a bolster had laid their heads on it and fallen asleep<span class=
"corr" id="xd24e7973" title="Not in source">.</span> And there they
would remain in peaceful slumber till the return of King Arthur, or
till a more godly bishop than has hitherto been should occupy the
throne of St. David. When that happens, Merlin himself is to be
disenchanted and restore to liberty the dormant saints. An inquisitive
woman named Gweno, who, led by the devil, sought to spy on the saintly
brotherhood in their long sleep, was punished by losing her way in the
passage of the mine. She, likewise, remained in an undying condition,
but was suffered to emerge in storm and rain, and in the night, when
her vaporous form might be seen about the old Ogofau, and her sobs and
moans were heard and frightened many.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. F. S. Price, in his interesting &ldquo;History of
Caio,&rdquo; says that another legend is that one of these saints
appears to have a special commemoration, but under a female appelative
in &ldquo;Ffynon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clochdy Gwenno,&rdquo; the latter an
isolated rock standing up in the midst of the great gold excavations,
and marking their depth in that particular place. The well had, in good
old times, a high reputation for healing virtues, and that &ldquo;on an
unfortunate day, Gweno was induced to explore the recesses of the
cavern beyond a frowning rock, which had always been the prescribed
limit to the progress of the bathers. She passed beneath it and was no
more seen. She had been seized by some superhuman power, as a warning
to others not to invade those mysterious &lsquo;penetralia,&rsquo; and
still on stormy nights, when the moon is full, the spirit of Gweno is
seen to hover over the crag like a wreath of mist.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">ST. GOVAN&rsquo;S.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">About seven miles from Pembroke, and a mile from
Bosheston, there is a small chapel of rude masonry half way down the
cliff <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>known as St. Govan&rsquo;s Chapel. It is a
seaside building, perched across a fissure in the side of the cliff,
and a long <span class="corr" id="xd24e7985" title=
"Source: fight">flight</span> of steps leading down to it from above.
There is a popular belief that these steps cannot be numbered by anyone
correctly, or &ldquo;counted by none both ways alike.&rdquo; I visited
the spot myself in October, 1909. In the east wall of the Chapel a
doorway admits into a cleft of the rock in which is a marvellous cell
or crevice, &ldquo;that enables the largest person to turn round
therein, and at the same time quite filled by the smallest.&rdquo; This
cavity has been regarded by the superstitious as a miraculous cell, and
according to a legend Our Lord on one occasion, when pursued by His
enemies, the Jews, sought safety in this neighbourhood. &ldquo;Passing
through a field where men were sowing bailey, He ordered them at once
to go for their reaping hooks, and, if any passed that way and inquired
after Him, to say that they had seen such an one, but it was in sowing
time. The men although they knew not who it was, did as they were bid,
fetched their hooks, and lo! on their return, the field was waving with
ripe corn. Whilst engaged in the reaping, a band of men accosted them,
as was expected, who, having received the appointed answer, gave up the
chase in despair. The Lord, meanwhile, had been concealed in this
crevice, which had opened to receive Him, and still bears a faint
impression of His person.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">According to another tradition which is still extant in
the neighbourhood it was St. Govan (Sir Gawain), one of King
Arthur&rsquo;s knights, that took shelter in this cell when he was
pursued by his pagan persecutors. The cell has been used from time
immemorial as a &ldquo;wishing place,&rdquo; and it is said that
&ldquo;all who turn round therein, and steadfastly cling to the same
wish during the operation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href=
"#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>will most certainly obtain their
wish before the expiration of the year.&rdquo; It is still resorted to
I believe by young people.</p>
<p class="par">A few yards lower down in the ravine is a holy well,
once much resorted to for the cure of diseases. This well was
frequently visited seventy years ago, and, it is said that its water
was so efficacious that some who came there on crutches were able to
walk away without them.</p>
<p class="par">There are, or at least were, somewhere in this part,
three upright stones, about a mile distant from each other. The
tradition is, that on a certain day these stones meet to &ldquo;dance
the Hay,&rdquo; at a place called Saxon&rsquo;s Ford, and when the
dance is over, travel back and resume their places.</p>
<p class="par">The late Mr. Thomas, Greenpark, informed me that there
was a moving stone of this kind in the parish of Llandyssul,
Cardiganshire.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rev. Peter Roberts, in his &ldquo;Cambrian
Popular Antiquities,&rdquo; says that Crug Mawr, or Pentychryd Mawr, is
a lofty hill in Cardiganshire, situated in the Vale of Aeron, mentioned
in Giraldus, where he says, &ldquo;there is an open grave, which fits
the length of any man lying in it, short or long.&rdquo; Hence arose
the ancient tradition, that a powerful giant, kept his post on this
hill, and was endowed with the genius of the Aeron Vale. He had a lofty
palace erected on the hill, and used occasionally to invite the
neighbouring giants to a trial of strength on the top of it. At one of
these meetings coits were proposed and introduced, and, after great
efforts, the inhabitant of the spot won the day, by throwing his coit
clear into the Irish shore, which ever after gave him the superiority
over all other giants in Ceredigion, or the land of Ceredig.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There is a well-known tradition in Cardiganshire,
and indeed all over Wales, that what is known to-day as Cardigan Bay
was once dry land. The country was known as Cantref y Gwaelod, or The
Lowland Hundred. It had sixteen cities, and in the beginning of the
sixth century the district was governed by a king named Gwyddno
Garanhir. As the land was below sea-level, dykes had been built to
check the encroachments of the sea. One day, however, Saethennyn Feddw,
that is, Saethennyn the Drunkard, son of the King of South Wales,
opened the sluices, and the sea flowed in, but the people fled to the
uplands.</p>
<p class="par">One of the ancient Welsh Triads commemorates the
inundation as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The three abandoned drunkards of the Isle of
Britain were, first, drunken Geraint, King of Siluria, who in the
paroxysm of a fit of intoxication set fire to the standing corn; the
conflagration in consequence of which rash act spread so violently,
that all the corn of the country, to an immense distance, was totally
consumed, and a destructive famine ensued.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The second was Vortigern, surnamed the
wry-mouthed, who when intoxicated gave Horsa, the Saxon chief, the Isle
of Thanet, for permission to have an illicit connection with his
daughter Rowena; and further promised, that her son, the fruit of that
amour, should succeed to the Crown of England; which proved productive
of treachery, and a sanguinary massacre of a prodigious number of the
chieftains of the Cambrian race.<a id="xd24e8047" name=
"xd24e8047"></a></p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e8050" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>The third was drunken Seithinyn, the son
of Seithyn Saidi, King of Dimetia; who when in a state of intoxication
suffered the sea to overflow Cantref y Gwaelod, where lands and
habitations the most beautiful in all Wales, excepting only Caerleon or
Usk, to the number of sixteen cities and towns, were in a short period
inundated and ruined. The lowland hundred was the property of Gwyddno,
surnamed longshanks, King of Ceredigion (Cardiganshire). This event
happened in the reign of Emrys Wledig. The inhabitants who escaped from
that inundation landed in Ardudwy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322"
href="#pb322" name="pb322">322</a>]</span>and ascended the mountains of
Snowdon, which had never been inhabited before that period.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There is a poem on this inundation in the ancient Welsh
book &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Llyvr Du Caerfyrddin</span>&rdquo; (Black
Book of Carmarthen).</p>
<p class="par">Near Wallog, a few miles to the North of Aberystwyth, a
causeway called Sarn Cynfelyn, extends several miles into the sea.
According to local tradition this is supposed to have been a main road
leading into the submerged country, and it is said that there was a
royal palace in this part. Other places which traditions associate with
the Lowland Hundred are Sarn Cadwgan and Sarn Ddewi, further South,
near Aberayron, and Sarn Badrig, in North Wales. So much has been
written on this subject, both in prose and verse, that it it not
necessary to dwell further on it here. But it is of interest to add
that there is a tradition, which is still extant that between Borth, in
Cardiganshire, and Aberdovey, in Merionethshire, there once stood a
town at a spot which is now covered by water. There is also a
well-known story of the chimes of bells being heard at the bottom of
the sea.</p>
<p class="par">Dwellers near Ramsey Sound, in Pembrokeshire, also hear
the chimes of bells in the sea, and this reminds us of the Story of
Grallon, in Brittany, who reigns beneath the waves.</p>

some generations ago, a man from the neighbourhood of Ystrad, was
sentenced at the Cardigan Assizes, to be hanged for sheep-stealing, or
some other such offence. The sentence, however, was not carried out, as
the criminal was a useful man, particularly so to the Squire who
happened to be the High Sheriff that year. But before the
Squire&rsquo;s year of office had elapsed, urgent inquiries came down
from the Government as to the execution, of which no report had ever
reached them. The Squire was so frightened at the Government&rsquo;s
inquiries, that he had the unfortunate man, who was out in the fields
at the time, seized, bound and hanged on a birch tree. One of the
Squire&rsquo;s servants entered a small cottage and begged an old woman
for the loan of her apron, but concealing from her what he was going to
do with it. When the old woman discovered that her apron was made use
of to blindfold the poor man who was so unceremoniously hanged, she
pronounced a curse on the Squire and his descendants. After this
everything went wrong with that Squire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">The most popular tradition associated with
Lampeter is that known as the &ldquo;Curse of Maesyfelin.&rdquo;
Maesyfelin was a stately mansion on the banks of the river Dulas, on
the east side of the town of Lampeter. It was once a place of
consequence, and an ancient family of Lloyds lived there. About the
beginning of the 17th Century the famous Vicar Pritchard of Llandovery,
author of &ldquo;<span lang="cy">Canwyll y Cymry</span>&rdquo; had a
son named Samuel. Tradition has it that this young Samuel was an
intimate friend of Sir Francis Lloyd, Knight of Maesyfelin, who was a
wicked man. At last, so the story goes, the two quarrelled over some
love affair, and young Samuel was stifled to death between two feather
beds. The body, tied in a sack and placed on horse-back, was conveyed
over the mountain in the depth of night and thrown into the river Towy
in Carmarthenshire. When the body of his lamented son was discovered in
the river, the broken-hearted father pronounced a curse on Maesyfelin
in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Melldith Duw ar Maesyfelin&mdash;</p>

<p class="par first">People believe to this day that the judgment of
God fell on the family and mansion of Maesyfelin. The palace delapsed
and no longer exists. Materials from its ruins were carried away to
repair Ffynonbedr, another mansion in the neighbourhood; but that place
is also in ruin now, so that it is believed that the curse of
Maesyfelin followed the material to Ffynonbedr. <span class=

&ldquo;next door&rdquo; to view the feast, when suddenly two constables
of the old fashion, made their appearance to demand the body of friend
John, his depredations having been found out. Mrs. David was frightened
and ran into her own house. She then called her husband. &lsquo;David!
David! Come down at once; they are going to take John of the next door

&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd24e8379" title=

dwr</span>&rsquo; is an old saying in Cardiganshire, especially in the
parish of Llandyssul. About the year 1830 my grandfather was constable
of the parish, &lsquo;<span lang="cy">Lladron Defaid</span>&rsquo;
(sheep stealers) were very popular at that time; so old Siams Isaac, of
Pantrhedynen, was called from his bed one winter night to take a
prisoner to Cardigan Gaol, who was caught red-handed in the act of
killing the sheep in his house. On the road going from Horeb to
Newcastle Emlyn the constable and prisoner went into a public house and
called for a pint of beer and bread and cheese each. After resuming
their journey for about a hundred yards, the landlady of the public
house called after them that the man had stolen a knife from the house.
A search was made, and the knife was found in the pocket of the
&lsquo;<span lang="cy">Lleidr Defaid.</span>&rsquo; After the usual
compliment of a few rounds of old-fashioned boxing, he was taken safely
to a place of correction, and never returned to Tregroes. So the old
woman who happened to live next door always said to John, her

<p class="par first">(A Woman&rsquo;s advice without asking for
it).</p>
<p class="par">When King Henry VII. (then Earl of Richmond) was on his
way through Wales to Bosworth Field, he consulted Dafydd Llwyd of
Mathavarn, as to the final issue of the coming struggle with Richard
III. Dafydd was a country gentleman, a bard, a wizard, and a prophet.
On this occasion, however, he did not know how to prophecy, and was
greatly perplexed. Fortunately, his wife was a very shrewd woman, who,
having discovered her husband&rsquo;s embarrassment or trouble of mind,
secretly advised him to tell Henry that he would be successful in
dethroning Richard III. and in making himself King. She assured her
husband that if the prediction failed of its fulfilment, he would hear
no more on the subject, but that it would make his fortune if confirmed
by the event. Henry went on his way to Bosworth, rejoicing, and we know
that the prophecy became true. Hence originated the proverb,
&ldquo;<span lang="cy">Cynghor gwraig heb ei ofyn</span>,&rdquo; which
implies that it is always a good thing to follow a woman&rsquo;s
advice, when she gives you an advice without asking for it.</p>

<p class="par first">The following appeared in the &ldquo;Western

<p class="par">According to a work just published on South
Pembrokeshire, the custom prevailing in that part of the country of
chalking the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>door-step dates back to Druidical times. The
object of this chalking was to keep evil spirits out of the house. The
patterns run round the slated steps, and, elaborate as they often are,
the essential thing is that there should be no gap in them, because the
evil spirits could enter into the house through the gaps. Does this
custom prevail in all parts of Wales? It undoubtedly does in
Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire, Glamorgan, and Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p class="par first">The following account by an eye-witness of a Wake
at Disserth, on July 9th, 1744, will prove of interest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e8469" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>At the end of a mead, by this river side
(the R. Ieithon), were a company dancing in a barn. They were about
nine couple, genteely dressed, and all people of fortune and fashion,
and I may with security say, the best and most active country dancers I
ever saw. We observed that the men were gay and genteel, handsome, and
well shaped; the women were genteel without pride, modest without
affectation, beautiful without art, and free without fondness. The
generous hand of nature appeared in every face, unspotted with the
artful follies of this degenerate age. It gave me a strong idea of the
happiness and simplicity of the ancient Britons before the Roman and
other corruptions overwhelmed the now refined part of the island (as we
are pleased to term it). But these zealots for liberty maintained their
independency long, and under this happy government they continue (and
they never end) their innocent customs, manners and recreations. A
favourite dance (Bumpers Squire Jones) I saw them perform with the
greatest spirits, order and exactness ... the churchyard, which, though
large, was filled with people of almost all ages and qualities. Near
this, was a little house, where we put off our riding coats, etc. The
church is a strong building, and pretty large, against the tiles of
which were a dozen lusty young fellows playing at tennis, and as many
against the steeple at fives. They played very well, but spoke (as
almost every one else did) in the Welsh tongue. On one side of the
church were about six couples dancing to one violin, and just below
three or four couples to three violins, whose seat was a tombstone. We
saw common games of ball played against the sacred pile, and there also
music playing over the bones of the deceased. We were in the middle of
a merry, noisy throng, without knowing their language, or indeed almost
anything they said.&rdquo;&mdash;Church Plate of Radnorshire, by J. T.

***** This file should be named 53915-h.htm or 53915-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by Cornell University Digital Collections)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
